Seemingly normal people can display extreme cruelty when given a socially acceptable scapegoat to vent their frustrations upon.  Popular sadism is still sadism.  Beware the dark passions of unthinking crowds.  Guard your own moral standards and meet them.
We must sometimes do things that we are not qualified to do.   Infants are not qualified to walk.  Growing up is a succession of tests we are not qualified to take.  This is what growth demands.
You can make a persuasive case that all your troubles are the fault of others.  You will convince some people.  You might even convince yourself.  Are your troubles now solved?
You will always find an excuse if you permit yourself to look for one.
A good teacher will arm you with the tools to dispute their conclusions.
If you think less of yourself after doing it... don't do it again.
It is only when a bureaucracy is deeply threatened that you can tell who is actually in charge.
Some people create constant trouble to distract themselves from the deeper issues they are avoiding.   They make sure there is always a new fire to put out.  They are both fireman and arsonist.
Journalists and politicians deserve each other.
Man thinks he knows the minds of others when he hardly knows his own.
Making yourself unhappy is a poor substitute for making amends.
"How often the end of a chapter feels like the end of the world.  And yet, we go on.  Error may beget prudence.  Hardship can build endurance.  Misfortune will become experience.  Each day calls us to the work of being ourselves.  The hour asks us to meet it, and meet it we must."
"When they lose their good sense, keep yours.  When they abandon their morality, keep yours.  Madness in the crowd is not an excuse for personal degeneration.  Be a fortress."
The work of centuries can be torn down in hours.  The destroyers will live and die in the ruins of something they cannot rebuild or replace.
An untruth is most dangerous when it becomes an uncontroversial banality.  We habituate ourselves to the sound of nonsense and cease to notice it.  Fashion takes the place of reason and the truth dies unmourned.
The tide of unreason rises.
Embrace the hard questions.  Be wary of the easy answers.
"Some prefer an endless fight to a win.  How flattering to always be the noble opposition, how free of responsibility."
They’d like to think for you and a part of you would like to let them.
Those who promote “righteous anger” may get more than they bargain for.  Anger rarely stays righteous for long.  It becomes an end in itself.
"The virtuous man may not have to stand alone, but he must be willing to."
The value of reading is now as much about the capacity to focus as the content of the book.  Regular reading is a practice that directs our focus towards something specific.  It is a counterpoint to a culture of increasingly fractured attention and compulsive pseudo-multitasking.
Chasing approval chases it away.
"You can “get a good education” by giving it to yourself.  Education is something you do, not something that passively happens to you.  Elite colleges sell a brand name and a networking opportunity.  The knowledge itself is in the library and in the device you’re reading this on."
"The default manner of engaging with social media leads to an enormous amount of time being wasted thinking about meaningless nonsense.  The micro-outrages, the celebrity gossip planted by PR people, the fake memes that promote Disney+.  Endless noise.  Filter it ruthlessly."
Emotions can give us information without giving us orders.
If you show interest in people they will show you that they are interesting.
Distrust the impulse to have an opinion about everything.
"We rarely appreciate all that our enemies do for us.  They test us and make us stronger.  They exploit our flaws, motivating us to correct them.  They show us what we do not wish to become.  So many memorable lessons.  What fine teachers our enemies are."
Most people are good when they are among the good.  Observe them in the company of scoundrels and you will find out if they are moral or merely conformist.
YouTube is full of teachers who will happily repeat themselves until you get it.  A rewindable instructor has infinite patience.  One of the great resources of our time.
Rage makes us stupid and fools us into thinking that our stupidity will somehow “show them.”
Amusing.
A good idea is a bad idea + a day of rethinking it.  Good writing is bad writing + a day of revision.  Quality is a process.
Valuable information is increasingly free.  The focus to learn and apply it is increasingly rare.
The ignorant can be instructed.  It is the incurious who are in trouble.
Many people are anxious and inhibited because they walk around with a comment section in their heads.  Famous people are often driven insane by the sense that they can’t possibly manage the opinions of so many.  Social media gives “normal people” this feeling as well.
Pause and ask yourself:  “Does this really need a response?”  Little annoyances come and go.  The irritation fades quickly if it is not indulged.
Don't expect insecure people to forgive you for your successes.
If you can enjoy a laugh at your own expense you are sure to find humor in each day.
Creative work often requires the creation of a problem to fix.  This is why writers emphasize the liberation of messy first drafts.  Our problem-solving skills are activated by the obvious flaws and solutions leap suddenly to mind.  The results may look like pure inspiration.
Do you have too many troubles?  Or are you troubled by too many things?
Meet bad fortune without self-pity and good fortune without foolish excess.
People who spend all day reading texts and Twitter will tell you “I don’t read. I don’t have time.”  You are reading this. You have time.  People read more than ever. They read plenty of marketing emails and angry YouTube comments.  Read something worthwhile.  Read a good book.
We shall meet greater and lesser men along our road and we shall learn from all of them.
Think long term.  Execute short term.  Appreciate the present.
"Reading offers a kind of telepathy.  It allows thought to flow fairly seamlessly from one mind to another.  Wide reading gives us a sense of not only WHAT others think, but HOW they think.  Reading permits us to commune with the dead and better understand the living."
The internet enables the obnoxious to monetize your reactions to their provocations.  Clickbait starves without clicks.  Withdraw your “engagement” from things you don’t want more of.
It may be wise to choose an excessively charitable interpretation of the other person in a dispute.  Perhaps you misunderstood their intent.  Perhaps you understood their intent perfectly and they will now embrace the more benign position as a way out.  A win either way.
"Avoidable personal conflicts constantly derail otherwise promising businesses, movements, and marriages.  Broadly well-aligned people should pause and appreciate the rarity of finding others with whom they have so much in common.  If you can... make it work."
Error is inevitable. Persisting in it is not.
"The real art of communication is not in making yourself impressive, but in making yourself understood.  It is a rarer skill than you might think."
"Your time has monetary value to advertisers, influencers, and Netflix.  It should have a deeper value to you.  It is your life.  Don’t give it away too cheaply."
"You can always find someone to talk you out of your own best ideas.  Feedback has value, but don’t use it as an excuse for stasis.  Do what you know needs doing.  Make yourself oblivious to irrelevant opinions.  Act."
Try to accept hard truths a little faster than other people do.  It is a great advantage.
"Unexamined anxiety can look like a lack of attention span.  People can’t focus when they feel the world is about to eat them.  Thoughts dart from one vague worry to another, like the eyes of a prey animal scanning for wolves.  Calmly examine your veiled fears.  They may diminish."
"Rapid learning requires a high tolerance for looking stupid.  The path to answers begins with the admission that we don’t know them.  Adopting the appearance of knowledge is a way to impress, but not a way to improve.  Ignorant questions are preferable to premature answers."
You don’t have time to “keep up” with all the irrelevant ephemera that marketers and manipulators want you to respond to.  TV can go unwatched.  Articles can remain unread.  Trends can fade away unnoticed.  Don’t react to things that don’t matter.  Make time for your life.
People who loudly advertise their virtues may be trying to draw the eye away from their otherwise obvious vices.  A magician flourishes with one hand as he works his trick with the other.  Quiet goodness is goodness.  Noisy goodness is theater.
The obedient student seeks the approval of an authority figure.  The ambitious student seeks to become an authority figure.  The genuine student seeks the truth.
How often we condemn others for failings we have already forgiven in ourselves.
"Doing anything public-facing in the internet age requires the ability to withstand a near-infinite set of hostile reactions.  Growth will convert some and enrage others.  Learn to weight 1000 silent likes over 3 angry comments, or you’ll give up just when you’re getting traction."
Belittling others is the lowest use for a good intellect.
"Modern tech has lowered the cost of insulting people, but the personal cost of feeling insulted remains as high as ever.  You can’t reform everyone who offends you, but you can manage your own responses.  When the stimulus is digital... assume you’re overreacting.  Stay centered."
People speak well of the man who does not speak too much of himself.
"An endless stream of mediocre “entertainment” is more medicating than entertaining.  The low-level stimulation keeps our anxieties at bay, but it doesn’t address them at the source.  Quiet would force us endure our own company and get to know ourselves.  No wonder we avoid it."
The version of you that will convince your critics won’t mind having critics.
The calm person makes a choice.  The angry person finds that anger has chosen for them.  Rage robs us of reason and makes us puppets of our lower instincts.
"We are asked to believe that the impossible is ordinary and the ordinary is impossible.  Fads and delusions run rampant.  Remember that popular madness is still madness.  Keep your sanity, even when sanity is the minority position.  Don’t follow the crowd over the cliff’s edge."
Overvaluing originality can cause you to embrace all kinds of highly original stupid ideas.  A man who is original in some areas may be a brilliant eccentric.   A man who is original in all areas is certainly insane.
We have time enough if we claim what time we have.
"We usually know what needs to be done, though we may wish we did not.  Ignorance would let us off the hook."
Feeling superior is an ugly indulgence.
"Libraries hold priceless records of other people’s mistakes.  We learn from pain, but it doesn’t always have to be our own."
"People now fear ill opinion more than injury.  Many cultivate a calculated blandness, a rational response to ambiguous risk.  They know ANY controversy will harm their permanent online reputation.  Free expression is becoming a luxury good that most people feel they can’t afford."
"We achieve nothing when we try to do everything at once.  Multitaskers make errors that singletaskers don’t.  Stop. Prioritize. Choose. Execute.  Do one thing well, then another."
Podcasts/audiobooks are very egalitarian innovations.  They allow busy people to turn their commute into a classroom.  Professional drivers and manual laborers often listen and learn as they work.  Generic drone of radio is replaced by audio of specific interest to the listener.
"Non-stop news, notifications, noise.  We can’t hear our own thoughts with so many voices in our heads.  Creation requires elimination.  Make some room for meaningful complexity by reducing meaningless complexity.  Carve out a space for slower, deeper thinking and generative work."
"An exercise for an age of reactivity:  Spend a week writing down everything that bothers you. Outrages in the news, personal slights, daily irritations.  Read it a month later. How many entries feel important now? Probably not many.  Excess reactivity steals happiness and energy."
Hatred is briefly energizing but ultimately exhausting.
It is easy to craft a plausible narrative that permits us to believe our troubles are all the fault of others.  Easy to paralyze ourselves with bitterness and idle blame.  Taking responsibility for our condition gives us the will to improve it.  It gives us the strength to act.
Character is the intangible quality that allows others to trust you and you to trust yourself.
Free distractions are expensive.  Everything costs time and attention.  Nothing is free.  Time is not a renewable resource.  Spend it on things that matter.
People are interesting if you allow them to be.  A routine social interaction is only a couple good questions away from something deeply involving.  People reveal their complexity when you give them your full attention.  Your interest gives them permission to be interesting.
Don’t compete with your neighbors.  Compete with your ideals.
The world will not always provide us with the certainties we desire.  We must grow comfortable with ambiguity.  An open question is preferable to a premature false answer.
Self-pity solves nothing.  It is an appealing way to avoid solutions and wallow in an addictive sense of helplessness.  Events will never conform perfectly to our desires.  Life is a teacher.  Bad experiences teach us that we can survive bad experiences.  Move forward.
Envy is a mirror that shows what you find lacking in yourself.
Those who want acceptance often seek fame.  Fame means they will constantly hear from people who don’t accept them.  Public attention is no substitute for personal affection.  Popularity attracts resentment like honey attracts flies.  Be careful what you chase.  You might get it.
Some people spend their whole lives waiting for the sound of a starting gun that never goes off.  Don’t wait.  Pull the trigger yourself.
"When actions contradict words, believe the actions.  Behavior reveals what speech conceals."
Most valuable information is widely accessible.  Great books of centuries past are free online.  Thinkers of today argue publicly on Twitter.  YouTube is a lecture hall that seats millions.  Podcasts are private tutors for the masses.  A golden age for the self-motivated learner.
Anger is good at telling us there is a problem.  Anger is not good at telling us the source of the problem.  Anger is very bad at telling us the solution to the problem.
Those who exert themselves in times of ease survive in times of struggle.
"There is no age at which we should cease to learn.  Fresh knowledge continuously reshapes our sense of the world around us.  Learning keeps the world alive to us, and us alive to the world.  Education doesn’t end in graduation.  It ends in the grave."
You can always find a “good reason” to put off what needs to be done.  Time will turn excuses into regrets.
The easily flattered are easily fooled.
"Learn from your past experiences, but don’t get stuck in them  Your past should be a teacher, not a jailer.  Don’t squander the present dueling with the shadows of the past.  This moment is alive with possibility."
"There is no downside to endurance.  If you can endure more, you can do more."
Simple personal failings bring ruin to the poor and the powerful alike.  Basic mistakes doom lives more often than complex ones.  Watch your demons.  They have a way of sneaking up on you.
All our civilization lies atop an ancient boneyard of struggling ancestors.  How easily the ignorant living denigrate the fading memory of the mighty dead.  We think in their words and live with the hard won rewards of all their striving centuries.  Be worthy of their legacy.
Today’s hot pain is tomorrow’s cold wisdom.
Emotions arise unbidden and are indulged at will.  You don't have to believe every thought or act on every impulse.  Self-restraint is not self-censorship.  It is not about fear of reprisal.  It is about aligning your actions with your deepest convictions.
"Why did the insult bother you?  If it is false, it has no weight.  If it is true, it is better to know.  Either way, you are unharmed."
Fools perform the service of teaching us how to endure fools.
"A leader must learn to look people in the eye and say:  ""I trust you. I know you'll make it work.""  Give them a chance to surprise you.   They often will."
A smartphone can be a time saver or a time waster.  These devices can double your effectiveness or halve it.  Impulsive use tempts you to trade your time for trifles.  Intentional use allows you more control over your life.  These tools are good servants and bad masters.
Don't let your enemy make you more like him.
Friendships are forged in years and broken in moments.  The impulsive and reactive will set fire to many worthwhile relationships.  A long-lasting friendship offers a deep and singular kind of companionship.  Forgive the little things.
This is an age of hyperbole.  Every day provides a new false emergency.  A stable and centered individual has a real advantage in an environment where overreaction has become the norm.  Make your own moves.  Avoid getting carried away by the passing moods of the crowd.
We are most easily deceived by that which we most desire.
Many people want to be SEEN to be something more than they want to BE that something.  Most personal progress happens without an audience.
Partisan news outlets distort the world in order to provide the viewer with an appealingly consistent narrative.  Dogmas are reinforced and enemies are engineered.  Events are interpreted and “contextualized” with a moral shading that reliably flatters the target viewer.
Wishing you had spent your time differently only wastes more time.
Outward action and inner calm.
"Rise to meet the day like the morning sun hits the cliffs, like the waves strike the shore.  Life is here today, sun bright and blood hot.  Embrace it."
"A few hours in the zone may be worth more than weeks in the haze.  Creative people should notice and cultivate the state in which they excel.  Crafting the conditions that promote excellence may not feel like important work, but it leads to important work.  Perfect the process."
"A crisis can bring about despair, or it can summon forth the will to power renewal.  A darkening hour motivates us to find a source of lasting light.  Catastrophe can introduce us to heroic qualities we did not know we possessed.  Courage and effort will light the dark."
The simplest principles will come to your aid in the most complex predicaments.
"Hard lessons are hard to forget.  Let hardship be a source of knowledge, not bitterness.  Wisdom is hard-won."
"The culture has moods and tempers.  It shifts one way, then the other.  The fashion forward quickly become fashion victims, as trends betray the trendy.  Find a source of stable calm in this environment of noisy uncertainty.  Don’t let the culture’s moods dictate your own."
"Old books teach urgent new lessons.  People read more than ever, but mostly low-value material.  Unwanted emails, ragebait articles, insane social media babble... largely worthless ephemera.  Quiet libraries are full of half-forgotten marvels.  The undimmed genius of the ages."
Failure can teach endurance or timidity.   Make it the former.  Knowing the taste of failure and risking it anyway... that is courage.
"The more you know yourself, the more you will forgive others."
Some look for people they can feel superior to.  Others look for people they can learn from.  The first is a path to stagnation.  The second is a path to growth.
Fear empty words more than silence.
"Distraction is the disease of the moment.  Mobile games, clickbait articles, obnoxiously repetitive pop songs.  Distraction without satisfaction.  Just interesting enough to keep the mind noisy and unfocused.   A little silence will allow deeper truths to surface."
"Rise to the level of your ideals, not the average of your environment."
"The perfected future never arrives.  Life is full of seemingly endless trouble, and then life ends.  Find peace in the imperfect present."
"People who successfully insult you take ownership of your time and energy, hijacking your mood and schedule.  “Letting things go” isn’t just about sweet forgiveness.  It’s about conserving your energy and attention for the things that matter."
Learn the newest skills and the oldest principles.  The timely and the timeless will combine in powerful ways.
Don't let the internet brainwash you into thinking in clickbait cliches.  Unplug from the narrative.  Watch your own thoughts.  Observe your emotions as they arise.  Discover who you are and who you could be.  Tune out the endless meaningless noise.  Find the path and walk it.
Where is trust being built?  Where is trust being broken?  Questions worth asking if you are looking for an approximate sense of what the future might hold.
"Free people can speak freely.  If you fear to speak, you aren’t free."
Anger usually worsens the problem it feels like the solution to.
Obedience allows others to control you.  Temperance allows you to control yourself.  Don’t confuse them.
"It is entirely possible for a person to be honest, well-meaning, and wrong.  Be forgiving without being gullible."
An honest man will sometimes repeat himself.  A liar can always find a surprising new angle.  The truth resembles itself.
A quiet voice in the back of your mind may whisper to you when you’re about to stumble into error.  That is the voice of the future you.  The you that will live with regret.  The voice urges you to transcend the impulses of the moment.  It asks you to reach higher.  Listen to it.
"People shrink from improvement because improvement is change.  The familiar is well mapped, we feel adjusted to it.  Change draws us into a world of uncertainties.  Life demands transformation.  We can drive it or simply watch it happen to us.  Either way, change will come."
"Chronic overwhelm is the inevitable result of the refusal to make tough choices or accept trade-offs.  You can’t do anything well if you are trying to do everything at once.  Overwhelm will be solved with definitive decision-making, not “time management.”"
"""Being engaged"" can be a way to avoid engagement with your own life.  ""Being informed"" is useless if the ""news of the day"" is irrelevant tomorrow.  ""Being caught up"" on low quality entertainment is a waste of irretrievable hours.  Your time is limited. Spend it wisely."
Awareness of death should only increase our appreciation for the wonder of life.  We are here now.
The obedient student will memorize and forget.  The interested seeker will explore and remember.
An ineffective person will fantasize about good outcomes.  An effective person will optimize the process that produces good outcomes.
Perfect plans must be turned into imperfect work.  Perfection is the privilege of the purely hypothetical.
Bad persistence: Endlessly doing the same thing with no success.  Good persistence:  Continuously tweaking your approach until you get results.
"If it can be improved, improve it.  If it must be accepted, accept it.  Embracing the inevitable frees you up to tackle what is within your control."
Dysfunction is invisible when it is the norm.  People will often congregate in a conspiracy of mutual stagnation.  No one has to feel inadequate if no one ever progresses.
"If you look for something to complain about, you will find it.  If you look for something to be grateful for, you will find it.  Most lives have their share of good and bad luck.  Gratitude is a choice of emphasis."
"If you reward the behavior, expect more of it.  This is true when dealing with others and when dealing with yourself."
Everyone can teach you something if you have an appropriately broad sense of what constitutes a lesson.  A negative example is as instructive as a positive one.
Twitter is home to brilliant people from many fields.  They could provide true insight into the topics they understand deeply.  What do these intelligent people do with Twitter?  They mostly write about politics with the same ignorance as everyone else.  What a waste.
Every yes is a no.  Every no is a yes.  Every choice sacrifices alternatives.  This is the nature of things.  Make choices or they will be made for you.  Choose your sacrifices and embrace them.
Don't respond to provocation with imitation.
The animal acts and does not reflect.  The indecisive man reflects and does not act.  The average man reflects after he acts.  The wise man reflects before he acts.
Starting pointless interpersonal conflict is a reliable way to avoid doing anything productive or meaningful.  Drama provides an excuse for stagnation.  People start fires and then praise themselves for putting them out.
Understanding 10% of a hard book is still a victory.  You’ll understand 0% of the book you’re too intimidated to try to read.
“Why did they insult me?”  Bad question.  “Why did I feel insulted?”  Good question.
Confront the vague anxiety to discover its specific source.  Locate the particular problem.  Attack the rot at its roots.
The internet makes great teachers widely available.  Your opportunity to learn is limited only by your ability to direct your attention.  On-demand education can't easily compete with on-demand stimulation.  A disciplined seeker will find no competition among lotus-eaters.
"Writing is good. Rewriting is better.  A well-worked sentence can offer insights that have been sharpened to precision by revision.  The process encourages the writer to think clearly and convey just what they mean.  Revised writing is the polar opposite of a ""gotcha"" interview."
Time spent mastering the basics is time well spent.
A rush to judgement is often a rush to error.  It is easy to find ourselves administering a counterproductive “cure” to a misdiagnosed problem.  Well meaning people with no humility can be very dangerous.  Good intentions shouldn’t be used to rationalize bad results.
"Trust is built slowly.   Trust is destroyed quickly.  Trust can make complex things possible.  The absence of trust can make simple things impossible.  Trust powers relationships, businesses, nations.  Trust is as precious as it is fragile."
You can’t teach a person who insists they know everything already.  They have some painful unlearning to do before they’ll be able to learn anything.
"Exercise authority over yourself, or you will be made to bow to the authority of others.  Be your own lord and master."
Hot emotions overpower reason and derail long term strategy.  If you are highly reactive you will be continually lured into unwinnable games.  Learn to pause just long enough for your senses to catch up with your circumstances.  Give your best self time to win the inner argument.
Meaningless micro-problems offer a convenient distraction from the major problems we fear to confront.  Don't trim the hedges when the house is on fire.
"Learning is easier if you are honest about your own ignorance.  People want to seem ""in the know."" They try to signal that they are intelligent and informed. This is often counterproductive.  Insecurity is the enemy of learning.  A master knows how to be a beginner."
Growth will convert your doubters better than verbal defensiveness.  Outgrow your critics in every sense.
Opinions drive conversation.  Convictions drive action.
Deceivers exploit fear and desire.  A fearless contented person is very hard to fool.
"People usually have a reason for being upset, though it may differ from the reason they declare.  Outbursts provide information about their emotional state, even if the cause is misdiagnosed.  Don’t take everything literally."
Unheralded virtue is still virtue.  Fashionable madness is still madness.
"Unwritten thoughts slip away like last night’s dreams.  A good sentence can carry the light of insight, undimmed, across years, decades, and centuries."
"People have original thoughts in the shower because it is one of the only places in modern life that offers refuge from entertainment, compulsive workaholism, and social hyperconnectedness.  The isolation allows you to hear yourself think.  Morning meditation for the masses."
Anxiety contaminates the present with the pains of all imaginable futures.  We cannot experience the fullness of the moment if we are forever suffering from hypothetical hardships.
Finding information is easier than ever.  Filtering information is harder than ever.  We are bombarded with irrelevant data and unsolicited stimulation.  Choosing what to ignore is as important as choosing what to pay attention to.
News (like alcohol) is better as a periodic indulgence than a constant compulsion.
It is easy to blame “them.”   It is hard to confront “me.”  The easy path is the road to ruin.  The hard path is the way of growth.
"A little pain is a reminder of the value of everyday good health.  A small betrayal reveals a person's nature, allowing you to avoid darker surprises in the future.  The death of a friend is a reminder to better appreciate those friends still living.  Contrast gives life meaning."
"You forfeit the freshness of the morning if you immediately open Twitter and email.  Doing so allows many voices into your mind. These voices alter your mood, spark anxieties, and compete to set your agenda.  Start your day however you choose, but be sure that YOU are choosing."
"We reveal ourselves in our deeds, not our declarations."
The internet provides access to an education that the aristocracy of old couldn't have imagined.  It also provides the perfect attack vector for marketers to exploit cognitive vulnerabilities and dominate your attention.  A world-class education is free for the undistractable.
The way people respond to you online may have everything to do with the kind of day they’ve had and nothing at all to do with you.  Don’t take it too literally or personally.
Modern people sit comfortably in air conditioned rooms and derange themselves with misinformation and hyperbole.  “The world is going insane!” they shout at an unhearing screen.  The world? Or you?
When you are upset you are likely to sacrifice the wellbeing of tomorrow to appease the hurt feelings of today.  Not a good trade.  Subject your emotions to a cooling-off period before you allow them to guide major decisions.
"Polarization and conflict produce online engagement.  Engagement is the object of desire for corporations, politicians, ruthless self-promoters.  Our emotions are held captive by contrived controversies and phantom threats.  Master your emotions, or they will serve other masters."
"""Why did this happen to me?""  Why not?  Events will never conform perfectly to your desires.  Move forward."
Old vices return in the guise of new virtues.
"Nothing hurts like the truth.  If we are forbidden to offend, we are commanded to lie.  Most truths will be offensive to someone.  Polite lies can do as much damage as malicious ones."
It is fruitless to wish you had started years ago.  In the future you will wish you had started now.  Don't wish.  Act.
"Human beings worry incessantly about their social status.  Making every device ""socially connected"" turned every device into an anxiety machine.  The machine becomes symbolic of the set of all people that may be judging you.  If ""hell is other people"" then hell is in our pocket."
It is the fire that refines the ore.  It is the hammer that shapes the metal.  We grow when effort and purpose collide with novelty and adversity.
If you are easily provoked you are easily controlled.
"People tend to avoid the important work they fear by doing unimportant work that wears them out.  They suppress anxiety with exhaustion, but they do not address the source of the problem."
"Twitter is dominated by reactions to other reactions.  Whatever the event, political tribes affirm their identity by attacking a poor response from some arbitrarily chosen member of an opposing tribe.  Random accounts with bad takes become strawman symbols of the hated other."
Free speech is a tool that rusts if it isn’t put to regular use.  What good are “rights” if people fear to use them?
The individual mind is clashing violently with the institutional mind.
Guilt has served its function when the lesson has been well and truly learned.  Thank it for its service and let it go.
Don’t do things you’ll lie to yourself about later.  Live in a manner you can bear to remember accurately.
There is nothing more precious than trust.  Low trust environments are full of friction and inefficiency. Every interaction is a fierce negotiation.  Trust makes a marriage warm and a nation wealthy.
"Many ambitious people hate seeing a friend succeed. Their resentment kills the relationship.  This is an error, even from a position of pure self interest.  Successful friends are useful.  Surges of envy reveal your desires.  The negative feeling originates in you, not the other."
"Sabotage groups are at least as common as support groups. Indeed, they often label themselves as support groups.  They conspire to hold each other in stasis. Destructive behaviors are normalized. Progress is subtly ridiculed.  Members trade ambition for dysfunctional camaraderie."
Clicks of rage are as valuable to publications as clicks of interest.  Don’t reward the manufacturers of outrage clickbait.  Remember that clicking it subsidizes the production of more of it.
Try to avoid making important decisions when you're angry.  Acknowledge the emotion.   Recognize that it clouds your judgement.  Remember that angry people tend to sacrifice the long-term good in response to short-term provocation.
Emotions are easily hijacked by illusory threats that tap into our insecurities.  We can’t be strategically dynamic if we are always on the defensive.  We are more effective when we realize how many things don’t require any response at all.
Most people are deeply concerned with managing their own image.  We want everyone to like us. This made sense in small tribes where ostracism meant death.  Why does fame make people neurotic?  Because they know they can’t possibly manage the opinions of the entire world.
One lesson from the success of podcasts and YouTube: there is an enormous market for digital companionship.  We are profoundly social creatures. Modern life can be lonely. We miss the chatter of the ancestral campfire.  We import voices to fill the silence and feel less isolated.
We are vulnerable to the effects of truths we are unwilling to face.  Perhaps they threaten our ego or the mental model that structures our routine.  Disturbing information is easily rationalized or ignored.  Trouble grows in the shadows we fear to illuminate.
"Trendy psychobabble is convincing many healthy people to view normal events as ""traumatic.""  We shouldn't fashion ""trauma"" out of minor occurrences which might be better understood as ""experience.""  Trauma is a heavy weight.  Experience is a valuable education."
The deeply insecure often hide it with an attitude of false superiority.  They compulsively insult people they feel inferior to.   They guard a fragile self-image by keeping those who intimidate them on the defensive.  They attack others for what they find lacking in themselves.
"Short-term thinking makes people desperate, ungenerous, impulsive.  Long-term thinking makes people calm, gracious, controlled.  The mighty pyramids and cathedrals were built by civilizations with a long time horizon, so it is with the life of a great man."
It's usually easy to guess a person's politics if you know which version of history they subscribe to.  How can people agree on the future if they are telling incompatible stories about the past?
"Be wary of headlines that presume to know your opinion.  Salesmen call this technique ""assuming the sale.""  Stop and identify the premise you are being asked to buy.  Do you want to?"
Exhaustion is the drug of choice for conscientious anxious people.
"The things you give your attention to are shaping you, even if you are only reacting against them.   They are modulating your mood and filling your head with fantasy scenarios.  Pay attention to what you're paying attention to.   Become conscious of your focus and guide it."
"When the basics appear to be absent, state the obvious.  It may not be as obvious as you think.  A delusion grows powerful when reasonable people pretend they don’t see it."
"Little misfortunes introduce us to our hidden strengths.  Our trials should act as an armorer, fitting us with defenses that can withstand real adversity.  Untested people feel more feeble than they are.  We can endure more than we know."
"A change of scene won’t solve a problem that originates in the landscape of the mind.  People are miserable in the city and the country, in grand estates and tiny apartments. There are many who are happy in all these places.  Is it our environment we can’t tolerate, or ourselves?"
"Even the most promising venture can be derailed by interpersonal conflict.  A dysfunctional team will find creative methods of self sabotage.  High trust environments produce many pleasant surprises, low trust environments produce many nasty ones."
"Fixing something broken is often easier than engineering perfection out of thin air.  Ideas in our heads are perfect as long as they remain ideas.  Bringing them to life involves a collision with the limitations of reality.  The perfect idea is broken, giving us something to fix."
"An hour of focused attention may be worth more than days of partial attention.  This is true for work and for relationships.  Chronic “multitasking” is a symptom of messy decision making.  Don’t try to do everything at once.  Do one thing well, then do another."
Writing gives thought solid form.  Get your raw mental process on paper.  Read. Revise. Reduce. Clarify.  Disciplined writing is disciplined thinking.
"We needed all the information we could get.  All gossip is relevant in a small tribe.  We had to know where prey slept and where lions hunted.  There was no such thing as ""too much information.""  Modern tech has changed the game.   We are overwhelmed with irrelevant data."
We stand in our own way and complain that our path is obstructed.
"You have to grapple with a problem to know the scale of it.  Starting is the vital step.  An ambiguous threat must be transformed into a specific challenge.  To solve it, start it.  Your problem solving brain will kick in and surprise you with solutions.  Begin by beginning."
The internet offers unlimited access to high value information and low value distraction.  It is as good as your self-control.  Make it serve you.   Don't serve it.
Some people want to be widely influential AND universally well liked.  Impossible.
A great book can transmit years of wisdom in a few afternoons.  Each sentence conveys meaning with precision and economy.  A great book is a patient teacher and a deathless companion.  A man with a good library has a thousand good mentors.
Obscurity is a blessing for beginners.   It allows for low stakes experimentation.  The mistakes you make in obscurity prepare you to excel in the spotlight.
Learn to control your reactions or you will be puppeteered by anyone capable of provoking you.
Your relationship with yourself is a marriage from which there is no earthly escape.  Death is the only divorce.  A well-ordered mind is at home with solitude.  A contented man can tolerate his own company.
Time takes vengeance on vanity.
Infants aren't qualified to walk.  We can only develop by doing what we aren't yet qualified to do.
The world suffers a million emergencies every minute.  Modern tech allows them to compete for your attention.  Indulging in constant disaster voyeurism will leave you feeling like a prey animal even if your immediate environment is safe and comfortable.  Don't derange yourself.
"Some make a name for themselves by destroying the reputations of others.  This can bring them a lot of attention in the short-term, but it will be their undoing in the long-term.  No one will come to the aid of a scandalmonger in distress.  Defamers die lonely deaths."
By his acts you will know him.  His words may obscure.  The arc of his actions will reveal.
"Wrongdoing may be forgiven, but it should not be rewarded.  Softhearted people often have trouble with this distinction."
Pain is a teacher that commands the attention of every student.  A lesson learned from suffering is not easily forgotten.
Maturity implies a preference for plain truths over gilded illusions.
Starting drama creates trouble that we can feel productive by solving.  This can give us the illusion of progress even when our behavior is entirely counterproductive.
"Young people in need of construction go to college and are taught ""deconstruction.""   This is rather like hiring a demolition crew to build a house."
People who haven’t learned how to say no will always feel overwhelmed and oppressed.
Many who claim to seek “motivation” actually seek “affirmation.”  They want to feel better about what they already are.  Affirmation is not the path to growth.
Helplessness is a dangerous addiction.
The most dangerously effective censor is the one you allow to take up residence in your own mind.
People who wrong you teach you a valuable lesson about your own vulnerabilities and false beliefs.  Learn the lesson.
Liars love jargon.
Those who have impact have enemies.
Curiosity is the engine of personal growth.  Curious people evolve. Incurious people stagnate.
Wise people say less than they know.  Fools say everything they know and many things they don’t.
"Adversity is always opportunity.  Life is full of trouble.  Life ends.  Denying these truths is an unstable solution. They will always surface, often when we most wish they wouldn't.  It is better to welcome the onslaught of adversity.  We learn to endure by enduring."
Good planning is insurance against future moodiness and inconsistency.  Do your important thinking when you are mentally sharp.
A civilization is demolished like a temple.   One pillar at a time.
A bureaucrat is someone who is paid to stand between you and the problem you want to solve.
"We imitate people who have what we want.  This makes sense, but it can backfire.  People raised on reality TV unconsciously mimic the spoiled children of the rich.   They are emulating people who are burning wealth, not earning it.  Look at trajectory, not present circumstance."
Twitter is only as awful as the people you follow.
"Obesity is a problem in rich societies. Too much abundance, not enough self-control.  The same can be said for ""opportunities.""  An abundance of opportunity offers many traps.  Every yes is a no to everything else you could do.  Choose your sacrifices intentionally."
Modern tech allows us access to so many voices.  You have to turn them off sometimes if you want to be able to hear yourself think.
Totalitarians can be recognized by their inability to take a joke.
"Blaming others makes us feel better about our shortcomings, but it doesn't help us address them."
Some people complain until they're exhausted and feel that counts as a hard day's work.
A person with charisma can make a friend quickly.  A person with character can keep a friend for a lifetime.
The written word preserves what memory neglects.  A fresh insight is a fragile thing.  Write it down.
Understanding 10% of a hard book isn't bad.   It may gave you the grounding to understand 20% of the next book you read in that area.  Deep knowledge is a mosaic.   It is put together piece by piece.
Many fear judgement more than failure.
Pay attention when you see someone do something seemingly impossible more than once.  That person is an anomaly.
Leaders must be willing to act with incomplete information.  You will never have enough data to remove all anxiety.  The world is simply too complex.
Freedom of speech is the freedom that preserves all other freedoms.  Free people speak freely.  A deepening silence is the sound of encroaching slavery.
If you don't want to obey others you will have to learn to obey yourself.  That is not as easy as it sounds.
Directed attention results in precise and effective action.  Divided attention results in clumsy and inconsistent action.
Well put.
People who say “everything is politics” give themselves an excuse to talk about nothing else.
Every person with a smartphone and a pair of headphones has access to the kind of education that was once reserved for the sons of aristocracy.
Podcasts are private tutors for the masses.
Praise is not the cure for insecurity.  Insecure people don't believe praise.

"Wit is no substitute for virtue, but it is a pleasing companion to it."
It is always tempting to embrace a lie that flatters us over a truth that would force us to change.

The cause of an event is often unclear.  You will feel less anxiety if you can learn to be comfortable with ambiguity.
China is imposing a surveillance society from the top down.  We are building one from the bottom up.
Perhaps bureaucrats give dull speeches on purpose.  They drone on in the hope that you will fall asleep and miss the bit where they announce whatever vaguely sinister policy they intend to pursue.
A darkening hour is as much an opportunity for heroism as despair.
An award for lifetime career achievement is a sure sign that either your life or your career will soon be coming to an end.
Be wary when you see euphemisms invading a linguistic domain that was occupied by plain and direct speech.  Vague language is imprecise for a reason.  What is being hidden?
A valuable long term mission can easily be derailed by emotionally loaded (but ultimately meaningless) short term drama.  Focus on what matters.
Schools teach obedience.  Obedience is being automated.  You can't compete with a computer by trying to become one.   Better to focus on strategic agility and lifelong learning.
An error sustained is a tragedy.  An error corrected is an education.
Words with meaning have weight.  It is hard to find substance in a stream of nervous filler.  Fewer words.   Greater impact.  Speak less and be heard more.
Effectiveness begins with elimination.  Choose your ignorances as carefully as your interests.
Self pity is the cause of many sorrows and the solution to none of them.
No one is more vicious than a disappointed admirer.
Most things worth knowing are whispered.

Pull a classic book off the shelf and you will usually find that the most indecipherable portion is the modern scholarly introduction.
Totalitarians don't like humor.  Laughter is the enemy of unearned authority.

Anyone can keep a secret that makes them look bad.  It is a rare person who can keep a secret that makes them look good.
Twitter is heroin for information junkies.
Many great artists combine the skills of an adult with the wonder of a child.   They help us rediscover what every parent has seen in the eyes of an infant.  They show us a tree as if it were the first tree.  They show us the world as we saw it when it was new.
Plain good sense is often defeated by absurd ideas with aesthetic appeal.  A falsehood can always flatter and please us.  The truth rarely does.
Not everything requires a response.  This is truth for many things in life and almost everything in the news.
Greatness is frequently unraveled by insecurity.
"Young men have youth and desire wealth.  Old men have wealth and desire youth.  In truth, youth and age both have their charms.  Appreciate the fruit that is ripe.  Don't weep for what is out of season."
Obsessing over your enemies will make you more like them.
Free speech is becoming a luxury good.  Most people cannot afford to risk the dangers of mob condemnation.  A few incautious (or misinterpreted) words can leave you jobless and socially isolated.  It is not surprising that people choose employability over honesty.
Behavior reveals what speech conceals.
There is nothing educated about a man who believes education is something that ends with graduation.
Living in cities distances us from the rhythms of nature and can blind us to certain truths.  It can deceive us into thinking that the social world is all there is.
It is easy to criticize what is present and hard to create what is absent.
We all do.
Do you enter a conversation to learn? Or to hear yourself saying things you already know?  You can't learn from anyone if you never stop talking.
"Anger is briefly energizing, but ultimately exhausting.  Anger clouds our judgement, leading us into one disaster after another.  Anger allows anyone capable of provoking us to manipulate our behavior.  Find a fuel that burns cleaner."
Tell a man a fact and he'll forget it tomorrow.  Spark a man's curiosity and he'll find the needed facts himself.
My best teachers died before I was born.  The receptive reader finds that a quiet library is not quiet at all.  It resonates with the voices of the ages.
"One must say yes in order to develop.  The young can benefit from saying yes to everything. Novel experiences reveal unknown talents and inclinations.  Experience also reveals that many ""opportunities"" are only a chance to trade your time away.  One must say no in order to focus."
"You can find paradise in poetry, but not in politics."
It is the barren silence of winter that makes the birdsong and blossoms of spring so enchanting.  Leisure after labor. Company after solitude. Home after a voyage.  Contrasts reveal the nature of things.  The world is always in flux.  Appreciate the season while it lasts.
Those intent on doing great evils often distract you with passionate condemnations of little ones.
Closets full of unremembered objects.  Heirlooms from our discarded selves.  Graveyards for the things we thought might make us happy.
"We must reckon with the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be.  Hard truths must be confronted.  The path to disaster is paved with self-deception."
"Why are the best among us often subject to the most ruthless attacks?  Many people see a good example as a mirror that reflects their own failings back at them.  They could learn from this feeling, or they could try to shatter the mirror.  Many choose the latter."
Many think great success will pacify their critics.  Quite the contrary.  Criticism will multiply as you grow and progress.  Positive attention does not come without negative attention.  This is the price of having an impact.
"Your attention has real economic value.  How much of that value are you capturing? How much is being captured by Facebook, or Netflix, or CNN?  Your attention has value to others.   It should be priceless to you.  Don't give it away carelessly."
The road to mastery is only traveled by those who can tolerate being a beginner.  Knowledge begins with the acknowledgement of ignorance.  Modern people may have to learn and discard many skills throughout their lives.  Those who can embrace being a beginner will thrive.
Conversation flows naturally when you focus on the other person more than your own performance.
School tends to punish exceptions.  Exceptional people are (by definition) exceptions.  The worst and the best are punished.  Those who cluster in the middle are rewarded for being undifferentiated.   This is a bad lesson that gives them a false sense of security.  No winners.
It is hard to tolerate timid writing where the point is completely obscured by disclaimers.  I discard it as soon as I get the sense that it is written by someone who writes in mortal terror of hard looks from their colleagues.
Effective action begins with the reduction of ineffective action.  You can't do anything if you are trying to do everything.  We are limited in energy and attention.  The world is chaotic and very complex.  Every choice is a sacrifice.  Choose consciously.
"A warrior must subdue himself before he can subdue his enemies.  Clear eyes see accurately.  The quiet mind thinks calmly.  The steady hand strikes decisively.  Mad passion flares brightly and quickly burns itself out.  Stoke the steady flames of discipline, wisdom, and will."
Some reach the heights of power.  Some live quiet lives of virtue and purpose.  Some seek nothing but mischief.  All find their way to the grave.  Time will make ashes of us all.  Do not squander this moment.  It will not come again.
The spotlight is hot enough to burn.  It lures its victims like moths to a flame.  Those who seek attention are seeking more trouble than they know.  The mob that raises you up may soon carry you to the guillotine.
Failures can be seen as information or they can be seen as a threat to your sense of self.  Embracing the former definition will help you learn and improve.  Succumbing to the latter will make you timid and resentful.
Dramatic anecdotes overpower statistical realities in the theater of the public imagination.  Most of us do not have an intuitive sense for probability and statistics.  We are bedeviled by exotic fears and oblivious to the everyday threats that we truly face.
Some people enjoy feeding off the fleeting thrill of whatever drama they can generate.  They enjoy negative feedback as much as positive. A reaction is all they seek.  Best to avoid letting them use you as a supporting character in the comic tragedy they insist on playing out.
"Listen to those you regard as enemies, take them seriously.  If they are even a little bit right you may revise your worldview to avoid costly errors.  If they are entirely wrong you may study their thinking for tactical weaknesses.  Silencing them ensures your own ignorance."
"A clever manipulator does not move openly. They plant the seeds of what they desire from you, but they do not force it.  You will re-examine your reasoning and think you have made all your own decisions.  They led you to the path and left you to walk it yourself."
Utopian notions rarely survive a head on collision with the realities of human nature.  An accurate view of mankind must account for the truth that one can experience both appalling cruelty and astounding kindness at the hands of strangers.
Reading widely allows you to be in conversation with the great minds of history.  What would Cicero think? How would Nietzsche respond to that? Where would Wilde find a joke in this?  The mind is peopled with those you welcome into it.
It is an enormous advantage to be able to speak and write clearly. These skills enhance all others.  Those who can clearly convey what they want are much more likely to get it.   Good speakers become leaders because others trust them to voice their concerns effectively.
"It may take decades to see the true impact of a change in values.  Those who brought the change won't fully internalize it. They will pay lip-service to the new ideas, but many will continue to run legacy code.  Their children truly believe what they're taught.   For good or ill."
A cynical student seeks an easy answer.  A curious mind seeks a hard question.
Cowards are bold in a crowd.  Weak men become murderers in mobs.
"Man likes to keep things as he feels they should be.  Nature insists on transformation.  Beauty that blooms today fades tomorrow.  We shall work our will upon the world, knowing that fate and nature tend to frustrate the ambitions of man.  We must be at home in impermanence."
"Reaction is the enemy of creation.  Creation requires deep sustained focus.  This focus is under constant attack by ""notifications"" that encourage you to respond to unending false emergencies.  Protect your attention and direct it to where it is most valuable."
Weak words grow weak hearts.  A people with no convictions are easily conquered.
We tend to punish those close to us for our own dark moods.  They cannot read our minds well enough to avoid offending us.  We lash out at them for the mistreatment we feel we've received from others who are not present.  Misery and mistrust spread like an airborne virus.
A minute of rage can undo a lifetime of diligent effort.  Self-control is self-preservation.  Most of us won't look back on the moments we acted in anger as among our finest.  Do not act when the tide of rage flows in.  Wait for it to go out.  Then act with reason and proportion.
You can tell an industry is in trouble when it starts handing out more and more awards.
There is arrogance and vulnerability wherever there is an excess of self-congratulation.
"There is a certain sort of busy man who rushes from one bad decision to another, applauding himself for his ceaseless activity.  He is always active, but rarely productive."
"The old are enlivened by the sound of young voices.  The young must hear from the wise, those who've seen many foolish delusions come and go.  It is not good that the old spend their days with the old, the young with only the young.  The generations have much to offer each other."
A thoroughly contented person is a huckster's nightmare.  He can't sell you a solution if you do not feel you have any problems.
Heroes provide an example that allows us to measure the distance between what we are and what we could be.  Most of us are good when being good is convenient.  Heroes are good when it is not convenient.  Their courage shames and challenges us.
Movements need enemies.  They will invent some if they can't find any.
For a few centuries man has tried to make himself like a machine.  He's learned to arrive on time.  He's learned to repeat after teacher.  He's learned to do repetitious tasks reliably.  Machines are now better at being machines than man is.  Man must now relearn how to be man.
"We read to make the acquaintance of ideas that we do not know we do not know.  We stumble upon a question mark in a curious place. We had never conceived of such a question, but now the mind longs for an answer.  A quest born of a book."
We evolved in environments where it made sense to overreact to every threat.  A lion in the grass requires an immediate reaction. Strike or be struck.  Our threat detection systems are not designed for modern life and are easily exploited by cynical marketers and propagandists.
"Your enemy wins when he persuades you to mirror his actions.   Divorce provocation and reaction.  Imitate your ideals, not your antagonizers."
"The young cry out for guidance and moral leadership.  They are handed a pamphlet and entrusted to a bureaucracy. Their existential concerns are diagnosed, pathologized. Medication is offered, and a hotline they might call.  And we are surprised that they're anxious and depressed."
Twitter is a great editor for those of us who tend towards overwriting.  All excess must go. Cut the long word where the short one will do.  Thought should be sharp enough to cut cleanly.
Let wisdom be allied with will.  Let effort be enhanced by self knowledge.  Let endurance resist adversity.  Let conviction and conscience light a path through the dark.
"There is tremendous power in acceptance.  To fully accept suffering and misfortune frees you from fear. You can appreciate good times because you are not tormented by the knowledge that they will end (they will). Such is the way of things, and we must live in accord with reality."
Twitter is the place where people who have become famous for doing one thing well are able to show the world just how little they know about everything else.
"“A slave is he who cannot speak his thought,” said Euripides.  True 2000 years ago.  True today."
"Artists are very often the first to harness untested new technologies.  They are comfortable in uncharted waters. They are happy trying things that may not work.  Artists journey blindly into the fog, feeling about in the haze, knowing they just might find something."
"People who appear to be ""failing upwards"" are sometimes masters of illusion.  They play the fool in public and make shrewd moves in private.  Assume there may be more to them than meets the eye."
Write every valuable thought down.  You think you won't forget.  You will.
"The ignorant can be taught, but the incurious are in for trouble."
"Love your enemy, but don't give him the keys."
Business is like nature.  It doesn't care if you arrive at the right answer from the wrong reasoning.  Evolution demands survival.  It doesn't ask you to show your work.
Many of the violent debates currently raging have as their subtext a question about what should be the canonical interpretation of history.  The combatants cannot accept their opponent's view of the future because they cannot accept their view of the past.
"It's not much later that she perfectly describes a cat as being ""priest and god of its own cult."""
"Humility and attention determine whether error will be a diversion or a final destination.  A life of ruin is often the end result of failing to take one of a thousand opportunities for correction.  All of us stumble into error, but we do not all stumble out again."
Turbulent times have a way of breathing new life into lost causes.  A ruin need not stay a ruin.  It can be the foundation for renewal.
"It is the fashionable curriculum of today that is arbitrary, not the great books of yesteryear.  The ""canon"" was not an oppressive monolith, but a record of furious disputation, of martyrs and madmen, scientists and statesmen.  You speak its language even if you haven't read it."
Many who appear to be seeking widespread popularity are in fact seeking acceptance.  Disappointment awaits.  Public prominence ensures that you will always be hearing from people who will never accept you.  Sensitive people are better off cultivating a few close relationships.
"Many people are waiting for the storm to pass so that they can sail calm waters.  They do not stop to consider that while they are indeed the ship, they may also be the storm."
This is an era of universal hyperbole.  Every day delivers a new banality disguised as an emergency.  Distrust your first reactions.  Begin with the assumption that you are overreacting.  Conserve your emotional energies for your real concerns.
Despising others won't make you like yourself more.  Quite the opposite.
This is a good time to study the political and social dynamics of ancient Greece and Rome.  Today's radically democratic tech has brought a new age of rhetoric and mob behavior. Athenians would understand these dynamics.  Learn more history and stop making Hitler analogies.
The fastest way to lose a fight is to let your contempt blind you to the strengths of your enemy.  It is when you are most threatened that you must strive most carefully for tactical objectivity.
"Compassion must be married to reason, or it will work against its own stated ends."
Fragile egos make for fragile friendships.
Old truths are made new again when the youth discover that dusty books hold secrets their parents and teachers never told them.
"It's unfortunate that so many modern children have been given cynical parodies of fairy tales, but not the undiluted originals.  Let them look through the wardrobe door while it is open.  Children experience mystery and awe with an ease that adults take LSD to try and rediscover."
One person with poisonous intent can rapidly unravel the social fabric of an entire organization.  Those in a position of responsibility should keep an eye out for such people and act decisively.  The limb must be cut while there is still time to save the body.
"Lasting relationships allow for the deepest communication.  Years of shared language and references enable exploration without exposition. You can get right to the heart of things.  An endless verbal tennis match, refining the aim and accuracy of thought and feeling."
"The bitter often band together into anti-support groups, conspiring to ensure no one succeeds.  Forward momentum is stamped out quickly by the ambient sense of disapproval.  Individual growth threatens the communal cover story.  ""If you can progress, what does that say about me?"""
Authoritarians are outraged by harmless opinions because they can't imagine that anyone could hold an opinion and not wish to forcibly impose it upon others.  They project their own authoritarian fantasies onto everyone else.
"Thank you. Your words are very kind, I'll remember them."
"How can one contribute to the dialogue in this vitriolic age without making things worse?  Discuss principles, not people.   Attack ideas, not individuals."
Don't expect to be forgiven for your successes.
A man who can find no fault with himself is not looking very closely.
Don't underestimate the value of moderate effort consistently applied.
"Why do people emphasize the lessons learned from suffering and failure?  Pain is the not the only way to learn a lesson, but it is the surest way to never forget one."
"The modern impediment to learning is attention, not access."
A miseducation is much more dangerous than no education.  An uneducated person has common sense born of pattern recognition.  A miseducated person has traded good sense for bad theories.
Dreams allow you to meet those parts of you that fear to introduce themselves in daylight.
Identity politics is poison.
Many mutually beneficial friendships have been killed in their infancy by jealousy and resentment.  Some people will react to a bright light by trying to snuff it out.  Don't punish your friends for their good qualities.   Notice when they try to punish you for yours.
"Mobs depise the best among us as well as the worst.  The worst unnerve us, a reminder of the lows we could fall to.  The best shame us, a reminder of the heights we could reach.  Bad examples and good examples will both incur the rage of the irrational mass."
"If we cannot persuade each other with words, we shall end up persuading each other with weapons.  Words hurt less."
"People who come to you with complaints aren't always looking for a solution.  Often they are looking for an audience, someone to empathize with what they perceive to be an intolerable situation.  They will respond to solutions with annoyance.  They simply want to be heard."
"Those advocating for censorship focus on the depravity of the ""justifiably"" censored rather than the fallibility of the censor.  Who do you trust to think for you? One man? One company? A bureaucratic body?  The ""correct"" view is often an elegant lie.  Truth is a chaotic process."
Prepare for waste and disappointment wherever you see good intentions married to bad theories.  Money isn't magic. Hard problems are hard to solve.  Don't recklessly throw resources at schemes that sound good but continually fail to bear fruit.
Boredom is rarely boredom. Life is very interesting.  Most of what people describe as boredom is in fact a deep dissatisfaction that emerges when the level of ambient stimulation is low enough to allow for self-awareness.  Awareness is kept at bay with compulsive activity.
"""Real talk"" is only as real as the talker."
Social media is very positive and profitable for a narrow set of people at the top of the distribution and is likely a net negative for almost everyone else.  Most haven't developed the skills to use it well. It captures a lot of attention and emotion for generally little reward.
Unstable times allow agile individuals to rapidly climb formerly gated hierarchies.
Don't outsource your ethics to schizophrenic cultural fads or to the social temperature of whatever room you're in.
The news allows you to dedicate massive amounts of energy and attention to things you probably cannot impact while the things you can impact go unaddressed.
A man with a specific solution to sell has every motivation to convince you that you are suffering from a very specific problem.
Power given to wise Augustus will one day be wielded by Nero.
"It is fashionable in enlightened circles to decry ""tribalism"" in all its forms.  This view is understandable, but incomplete.  Human beings are inherently tribal.  The leeway is in how we choose to define the tribe."
The easiest way to appear smart is to know your own sphere of competence very well and to avoid making declarative statements outside of it.
Self-criticism is productive and healthy.  Self-loathing is neurotic and destructive.  Don't mistake one for the other.
Accepting the inevitable is the beginning of strength and freedom.  Embrace all chaos that is out of your control.  This is how it is. Why should it be otherwise?  Move the levers that are within your grasp.  Sharpen the blade of will.   Strike with precision.  Accept and endure.
Be kind with people and tough with their ideas.
He'd get banned from Twitter.
Most public people now know that everything they say will be interpreted in the most uncharitable way imaginable.  Mobs and media mind readers will insist that their sinister projection of what was said is in fact the canonical interpretation.  This is why most choose blandness.
College is the most overpriced dating service in history.
Don't expect to get away with being a good example.  Good examples shame the wicked.  Wisdom infuriates ignorance.  Depravity despises innocence.
Envious sabotage likes to masquerade as principled criticism.
You amplify everything you react to.
The smart can learn quickly.  The smart and wise can unlearn as quickly as they learn.
"Many who claim to seek ""a conversation"" are only seeking an audience.  The only voice they wish to hear is their own."
Hoping to convince themselves by convincing everyone else.
"Skilled propagandists don't rewrite history with lies, they do it with emphasis."
Culture warriors can quickly become culture casualties.
"Learn from your past, don't live in it.  The past must be integrated, it cannot be wished away, but it also should not be allowed to devour the future.  Today is tomorrow's past, don't  spend it reliving yesterday.  See the infinite flowering of now."
Cleverness is not the same thing as wisdom.  Watching people react to tragedy will illuminate the difference.
Life is a storm that will test you unceasingly.  Don't wait for calm waters that may not arrive.  Derive purpose from resilience.  Learn to sail the raging sea.
Great stories have moral content without being moralizing.
A bureaucracy created to solve a problem will often decide not to.  Solving the problem would put them out of a job.
Twitter's reply function allows the literal-minded their revenge.
I'll take the uncredentialed man who has actually built something over the man with a piece of paper which asserts he is capable of it.
I'm often less interested in the rightness of your answer than in the clarity of your chain of reasoning.  Right answers can be borrowed or chanced upon.   Clear reasoning is the hallmark of a broadly well-ordered intellect.
"To be ""elite"" is to be, by definition, uncommon.  This explains the lack of common sense."
"A dying civilization is like a tree that has rotted from within.  Things may look healthy on the surface, but a storm will reveal the truth."
The essential nature of man has not changed in the last 2000 years.  Each era has its own delusions and taboos.  Written works from across historical time allow us some insight into the aggregate qualities of man.  We are not the end of history or the beginning of it.
The anonymous comment section is the only place in modern life where people actually say what they mean.
Compulsive liars and compulsive truth tellers will both tend to lose friends as quickly as they make them.
Befriend the truth and make it your ally in all things.
Old books light new fires.
"""I will be happy when I reach a state free of misfortune.""  Unlikely. Misfortune can be minimized, but never eliminated.  Life is full of seemingly endless trouble, and then life ends.  Peace must be found in the imperfect present."
You cannot address your weaknesses if you won't admit you have any.
"Honest thinkers not only describe their opponent's position accurately, they'll actually improve on it if they can.  They will state the opposing argument in a manner that their opposition would approve of and endorse.   Only then will they dismantle it."
Treat kids like they belong in a padded cell and they just might end up there.  The young are forced through a gauntlet of institutions that demonize normal behavior and pathologize them for their very nature.  Factories that produce neurotics.
"People say a lot of things that are factually false but socially affirmed. They're saying stupid things, but they are not stupid.  It is intelligent (though often immoral) to affirm your position in a tribe and your deference to its taboos.  This is conformity, not stupidity."
You don't really see the person that you are envious of.  You see a mirror that reflects what you find lacking in yourself.  Paying attention to this can be very instructional.  We often despise in others what we wish we could find in ourselves.
"If others don't value your time it is because you don't value it enough.   You allow it to be bought too cheaply, training others to expect access on demand.  Generosity is good, but you'll make more impact if your energy is directed.  Invest time carefully, don't gamble with it."
Scientists describe the world in terms of cause and effect.  Poets describe it in terms of cause and affect.
The narratives wage war and the truth loses.
"Those who seek applause for their goodness will certainly fail to be good, and probably fail to receive applause."
"Most modern people live in increasingly safe environments.   They use the news to import distant danger.  Their friction-free lives give them more and more time to fixate on far-off threats.   They are safer than ever, yet more and more fearful."
Know yourself well enough to recognize when you should avoid making a decision impulsively.  Recognize when your strongest emotions are trying to take the wheel.   You may need to enforce a 24 hour waiting period to allow your higher self to triumph.
Signalocracy.
"A willingness to be wrong in conversation can help you avoid being wrong in a costlier arena.  Better to lose an argument than a fortune, or a war."
Skilled propagandists weaponize words.  Master propagandists weaponize images.
A boy without a father will never stop looking for one.
Why do schoolchildren hate reading?  Just look at what they're made to read.
Deep knowledge of any discipline will allow you to notice the grotesque errors that are commonplace in press coverage. This brings about the disturbing realization that this must be just as true for areas you know nothing about.  Specific expertise cultivates general skepticism.
"How can you be content when you do not get what you want?  By seeing it as a test of fortitude and insisting on passing that test.  You may not get what you want, but you can successfully embrace that reality with grace and humility.  Life is full of troubles. Endure them well."
People will embrace absurd positions to avoid disagreeing with their former selves.  We often choose what is consistent over what is correct.
Modern people often feel most content in a hotel room.  They feel liberated by the novel emptiness. No closet of unworn clothes to remind them of past identities. No calendar to create anxiety for the future.  Many of the things we fear losing are things we would not miss.
"Demand freedom, and be worthy of it."
Think long term.  Execute short term.  Experience now.
"Drama provides a convenient distraction.  We light small fires and busy ourselves with putting them out.   Short term ""emergencies"" give us an excuse to ignore the long term issues that we don't wish to acknowledge."
"Interviews worth listening to are always between people who are interested in each other. This must be a two-way street, otherwise it is a performance, not a conversation.   Real value emerges when the participants forget the audience and try to impress each other with secrets."
Political correctness exceeds its authority when it demands factual incorrectness.
You need an education to recognize the absence of one.  A few generations of collective failure makes ignorance invisible.
People who don't know much history tend to assume the one bit they remember is completely applicable to the present.
Those who mistake manners for morality will do the most extraordinarily wicked things if they are asked nicely.
"You see it in the awkward body language.   They were not permitted to climb trees.   Never bruised or battered.  Insulated from impact and contact.  Unable to display or interpret expressions.  You hear it in the dreaded monotone, a voice unused to hearing itself."
That which blooms is that which fades.  Beauty and impermanence are bound together.  Flush of youth withers as quick as it ripens.  The river of time flows ever forward.  See all that blooms now.  Now.
"Puritans change clothes but not tactics.    These shrill and censorial individuals enjoy the sound of no voice but their own.  These are the people who, if they should stumble mistakenly into a museum, will have to fight the desire to clothe the naked and smash the unorthodox."
"The current literary scene is dominated by people who know nothing and very confidently ""write what they know."""
Meek equivocation is the signature style of the op-ed writer more concerned with career stability than ethical responsibility.
"Great books are great company.   They never cancel appointments, and they're always happy to join you in bed."
Much of modern education feels like an increasingly unhinged attempt to cure students of a disease they do not have.
The culture wars that were raging in a certain subsection of the internet 4 years ago are now consuming the culture at large.  An enormous intellectual realignment happened in silence.  The results of that change are beginning to play out.
The sharp edge of adversity can shape or shatter you.  Be like marble.  Let the chisels of the world carve you into the image of your ideals.
"""He seems to be getting away with it. I guess wickedness really does pay.""  Wait.  A little longer.  Just wait."
Envy is the mother of massacres.
A man who has just lost a game can easily be convinced it was rigged.
"A blank space on a map can be the site of nightmares and fantasies, or it can simply be a question mark.  We project our deepest anxieties onto the ambiguous.   Let a question mark be a question mark, free of emotional affect.  Let it be a cause for investigation, not projection."
It is safe and easy to offend far-off enemies.  The test for an honest person is whether or not they will break with friends when principle demands it.  Virtue is cheap when the crowd is with you and expensive when they are not.
"A day perusing the Twitter mentions of a ""prominent person"" would cure most people of any desire for prominence."
"You can have freedom without responsibility, but not for long.  The first thing an irresponsible man will do with freedom is give it away."
Crowds love coronations and executions.  The former is often the prelude to the latter.  Nothing stokes vengeful feeling like seeing another man praised.
Provocateurs are only effective insofar as their audiences are easily provoked.
This Samuel Adams sure does love the attention and controversy. He's only trashing the crown to sell beer!  I've had quite enough of this congressional dark web. Most of their ideas are stolen from Locke anyway.  Only paranoid eccentrics read the fake news in Franklin's papers.
"""There are no shortcuts.""  Not precisely true. There are shortcuts.   The problem is that finding one is no guarantee you will find another.   It is not a stable strategy in an environment of change.  Cultivate the problem solving capacity to address this problem AND the next."
About half of the negativity on Twitter results from failures of reading comprehension.
It was appalling.
A man who lives a life free of contradictions is either a saint or a liar.  There are more of the latter than the former.
"With experts like these, who needs amateurs?"
Pseudo-journalists know that if they ask enough idiot questions they will eventually be able to extract one idiot answer.
"Those who enjoy being the noble opposition will go to considerable lengths to avoid winning.  Victory would force them to transform into the hated incumbent, thus spoiling their entire business plan."
Writing on Twitter can feel alarmingly like writing in a private diary.   What you write in a diary can bring embarrassment to your family after you die.   Twitter eliminates this waiting period.
It is now completely acceptable in many ostensibly enlightened circles to use reputational destruction as a substitute for counter-argument.
"The decline of ""creative writing"" can be traced to precisely the moment it became a college major."
"All things fade and transform.  You cannot resent the loss of what you never felt was yours.  When you can act, act rightly.  When you must accept, accept entirely."
Innovation is often born as heresy.
"If their action contradicts their speech, believe the action."
"People will come up with extraordinarily convoluted theories to avoid admitting that they have been wrong about something.  It is always interesting to ask: ""What beliefs have you abandoned? What changed your mind?""  Most honest people will have a good answer."
We fill our lives with chaos to drown out that soft inner voice that can only be heard when things are quiet.  It knows too much.  It is easier to silence it than listen to it.
Adversity and catastrophe are inevitable in a universe where things fall apart.  Small misfortunes allow us to test our own resilience.  Trouble will come.   We must be ready for it.
The guilty often fear shame more than punishment.  They may choose the despot who offers a beating over the man who offers a good example.
"The costs of controversy are immediate, but survivable.  The costs of cowardice are delayed, but lethal."
Life is very interesting.  Boredom is a failure of imagination.
"Weak people are ineffective, but easily led.  Consider this when you encounter systems which consistently produce broken individuals.  It may be aim as much as accident."
Some people seek to corrupt the world in order to feel at home in it.
"Jealousy is information.  It tells you what you desire, what you admire, what you despise in yourself.  You could learn from the person you envy if you weren't blinded by resentment.  Learning feels better than loathing."
"You may not find a good mentor in the classroom, but you can certainly find one in the library."
Social media is very dangerous for people with low impulse control.
An accusation is not an argument.
Ours is an age in which any kind of moral seriousness is regarded as something deeply threatening and radical.
He who differs from the crowd in a few things may be an iconoclastic genius.  He who differs from the crowd in all things is certainly a lunatic.
You can't make a fortune in a society that won't permit you to lose one.  Volatility and risk allow for opportunity and mobility.
Character is a better policeman than coercion.
"So many seniors spend their evenings in the company of cable news.   They are isolated and ignored.  The lessons they could teach go unheard by a youth taught to despise everything antique, to distrust old wisdom.  Their once strong hands built what we take for granted."
A school that looks like a prison probably is one.
There is nothing obvious or inevitable about a complex society that works.
A life of purely transactional encounters is a quiet tragedy.
The modern world provides endless opportunities to do useless things that look and feel like work.  It is quite possible to be both completely overworked and completely unproductive.  You can get away with this for years in many workplaces.
"Beauty is a ruthless hierarchy.  Beauty is light and shadow and line.  Beauty enlivens the mind and arouses the senses.  Beauty inspires and frightens.  Beauty evokes the eternal through awareness of the transient.  Beauty is the color on the canvas, the melody in the noise."
The coming cultural confrontation will be between those who have built personal followings and those who are reliant on institutions for their platform and influence.  The latter feel the mechanisms of social control are beginning to slip from their grasp.  They are not happy.
You will be attacked for doing the right thing.  Do it anyway.
"Driveby defamation.  Favorite pastime for underpaid journalists and C-tier blue checkmarks.  Superior taste is demonstrated through casual condemnation.   A specific accusation is rarely made, but it is implied that they must be up to something vaguely sinister and contemptible."
There will always be extremists.   They only win when the moderates start apologizing for them.  Weak moderates are easily dominated by motivated extremists.  They meekly accept every imposition.  That is when things start to go very wrong.
"If you are doing something that has never been done before, you are by definition ""unqualified"" to do it.  Innovators push beyond the edges of the map."
Nothing frightens a tyrant like catching a slave with a book.
Never underestimate the motivational power of envy and resentment.
There are lies of emphasis as well as omission.
"This too, you shall endure."
"Open minds are the product of open books.  Reading widely gives you the understanding needed to reach your own conclusions.  It frees you from having to take things on faith or arbitrary authority, you can explore the origins of ideas and contend with the best counterarguments."
"Mastery and humility.  Experience gained in mastering one domain will be valuable in mastering another, if you can retain the humility that allows you to tolerate being a beginner.   Times of rapid change reward the individual who is able to continually master new circumstances."
A scientist will shape their conclusion to the data.  An ideologue will shape the data to their conclusion.
Common sense looks like fringe opinion if you are in a cult.
"It is much easier to ridicule the speaker than to refute the speech.   This is the go-to tactic for those who are clever enough to recognize a formidable argument, but not clever enough to disprove it."
We project our fantasies onto things we don't have.  We project our insecurities onto things we do have.  In both cases we are blind to the true nature of the thing.
Predictable people tend to create predictable models which predict that other people will be predictable.  They are unfailingly surprised by the terrible and wondrous creativity of the human spirit.
"Outraged agreement and outraged disagreement are equally desirable for the click-bait ""journalist"" who is paid by the pageview."
Responsibility over retribution. Courage over cowardice. Endurance over excuses. Creation over criticism. Discipline over desire. Action over reaction. Present over past. Fire over fear.
Never underestimate the fratricidal fury of sectarian disputes between people who agree on 98% of everything.
A drunk man can burn bridges much faster than a sober man can build them.
Good speakers are often dutiful writers.   Rewriting a sentence eight times will tend to affix a few fairly melodious variations of it into your readily accessible memory.
If it tortures you to think about it then you did not really get away it.  A guilty conscience is bad company.
Losing friends that are easily lost is no loss at all.
"Authoritarians are obsessed with wording. ""Repeat after me, in these words.""  They do it early, distorting your worldview before you experience much first hand.  Pressure becomes unnecessary. Your desire to appear consistent kicks in and keeps you in line with your former self."
No one gets to tell you what you cannot think or say.  No one.
Seth Godin understood this before most.
The quickest way to derange your thinking is to join a movement.
"It is possible to take something seriously, but not personally."
"Over 30,000 followers in the last three months.  Strange and wondrous times.  Thank you."
An hour of deeply contemplating your own moral failures will leave you feeling much more forgiving of the foibles of others.
Listening and encouragement.  These things cost little to give and are often priceless to the recipient.  Some people have never encountered a single person who genuinely wanted the best for them.
You never forget the person who offered a hand up in your darkest hour.
Older people do not understand that young males live in an almost entirely parallel culture.   They live in a world that revolves overwhelmingly around YouTube and video games.  Many important ideas that are shaping the wider culture are emerging untraceably from this realm.
"You are very fortunate if the most painful part of your day is reading or hearing something unpleasant.  2nd hand ""trauma"" is victimhood vampirism."
A good drinking partner offers a great evening at the cost of a bad morning.  Bright nights can seed dim futures.
"Kanye is creating a shocking fusion between normie Twitter and innovator Twitter.  An anomaly in the feed is a glitch in the culture, a break in the narrative.  Conversations that have been happening in this strange corner of the internet are being thrust into the mainstream."
"Youth sparkles with the potential of the undefined. That infinite anything that will so soon solidify into a limited, definite, something."
There are those who would gladly strangle you in an alleyway and still feel quite earnest providing a tearful eulogy at your funeral.
Modern people often feel very superior to their ancestors.  Many living today would not have survived long in the environment their forefathers had to contend with.  Honor the builders.  Respect the voiceless dead.
"The temptation to give up is often strongest right before you make it.  You know you are ready, but the rewards haven't materialized.  Persevere."
A toxic relationship with the past poisons the future.  This is true for individuals and for nations.
"Compete with your ideals, not your neighbors."
How can you thrive? -Learn fast. Move quickly. -Harness tech. -Abandon sunk costs. -Resist distraction. -Understand crowd behavior. -Rhetoric is rewarded in networked society. -Global society concentrates rewards among A+ players and those in a few fields with talent shortages.
Education system was designed to produce factory workers. Obsolete. Young people are entering an age of increasing complexity and rapid change. Capacity for continual self-directed learning is crucial. Those that struggle with abstract thinking and complex tasks will suffer.
"Thoughts on writing:  The first draft gives you a problem to solve.   Every unwritten work is a masterpiece, yet when you put pen to paper it rarely comes out that way.  Hypothetical perfection must be dashed on the rocks.   Now your problem solving brain can get to work."
He that is blown around by the winds of opinion will eventually be blown away by them.
One act of courage can shame the complacent crowd into action.
Nothing infuriates a critic like being ignored completely.
The right to offend is the right to save people from themselves.  Most people do not like being told they have a drinking problem.
Individuality looks like instability to the chronically conformist.
Now.
Irreversible mistakes are likely to be made when wounds are fresh and tempers are hot.  Time takes the heat out of most insults and injuries.  The impulse for revenge often cools into pity or amusement.
People never forget those who showed loyalty at their lowest moment.  They also do not forget those who showed disloyalty at their highest.
"People increasingly feel the need to precede every quotation with:  ""I don't agree with X on everything, but he makes a good point about...""  Is there anyone on earth that you agree with on everything?"
If you are looking for provocation you will find no end of volunteers.  Who is really to blame? The fool? Or the man who seeks him out?
Drama is distraction.  Many intentionally cultivate drama in their lives. They stay in a state of constant crisis and reactivity. This gives them an excuse to avoid changing.  How can they act with so much to react to?  They find like-minded enablers and play this game for years.
"Agile individuals presently have many advantages over sluggish institutions.   Institutions are risk averse, terrified of liability. They do not react quickly to cultural change because they fear being the first to move.   This is why their cultural signalling is 3 years behind."
Restricting speech doesn't seem to be a slippery slope so much as a stark cliff.   The descent into totalitarian absurdity appears to be near instantaneous.
Success is seen as proof of guilt by those with jealous minds and fragile egos.
"The high road is rocky, but uncrowded."
"Virtue attracts as much resentment as vice.  Vice disgusts, but virtue shames."
Disappointment awaits the eager eighteen year old expecting to bid farewell to the social dynamics of the high school cafeteria.
You'll find more arrogance among bronze medalists than gold.
Those who feel inferior and insecure will often hide it with a mask of discerning superiority.  They hope this affect will fool the credulous into thinking a stance taken out of envy is instead a position of singular sophistication and purity.
Seemingly overnight innovations always have more complex origins than is widely known.  There is always a backstory.
Many who desire control over others have very little control over themselves.  Beware the person who wishes to regulate your behavior but can't seem to regulate their own.
A wise employer knows that an uncomfortable conversation now is likely to prevent an uncomfortable firing later on.
Those with a reputation for telling harsh truths will be completely ignored in an age of comfort and complacency.  They will be aggressively sought after in times of danger and uncertainty.
Ideological people do not like humor.  Perhaps it is because they are not any good at it.  It is hard to be amusing when you are captive to so many taboos.
May the truth be your armour.
"There is a certain sort of elaborately evasive psuedo-complexity that people construct to avoid admitting that their theories are demonstrably wrong.  Impenetrable complexity can mean high resolution detail, or it can mean obscurantist fraud.  Telling the difference can be hard."
"Many want to be seen to be something more than they want to actually do anything.  They covet a label: leader, artist, altruist, unique.  They beg others to validate that self image.  This neediness is costly.  They are often outplayed by those working quietly in the dark."
Through the temptation  Through the crowd.  Through the doubt.  Through the loss.  Through the wall.  Through the fire.  To the end.  Endure.
"Conviction is much more powerful than ""positive thinking.""  Positive thinking is fragile and easily shattered by random tragedy.  Random tragedy is an inevitable feature of life.  Conviction guides you through misfortune.   It does not wish it away.  Purpose outdoes positivity."
"The average American watches over 30 hours of television a week.  How many would say they have a project they'd love to do if only they ""had the time?"""
Where should the righteous man stand?  Between the mob and the scapegoat.
Volatile times present a great opportunity for the agile upstart and a great threat to the slow-moving incumbent.
"Cowardice is contagious, but so is courage."
Worthwhile things are hard to do.  You feel foolish and out of your depth when you start.  Many find that intolerable and retreat to their comfort zone.  Each master was able to endure being a beginner.   Some learn to love it.  They live on the bleeding edge of their capacities.
"A fortune can be lost and made again, but the sand in the hourglass flows in only one direction."
The society with a strangling set of intellectual taboos will stagnate.  The society with the most unclouded vision of reality has a big advantage.
"Great conversation flows easily with those that are deeply committed to the truth.  They attack or defend a position out of honesty, not ego.  They seek illumination, not point scoring.  They will ruthlessly challenge the accuracy of your mental map of the world.  Invaluable."
A society of narrowly developed specialists is a society expert in seeing trees but not forests.
Humility to learn.  Strength to endure.  Vision to transform.  Will to act.  Virtue to act rightly.  Wisdom to accept the inevitable.
A well ordered mind is one that can tolerate being in its own company.
"A civilization that despises itself will accept any imposition.  It will feel the knife cutting at its arm and say:  ""I can live without an arm.""  Dismantled limb by limb.  Unable to walk. Unable to crawl.  All it will do is watch.  Until the birds strike out its eyes."
"If you choose, you are to blame.  Freedom of choice is responsibility.  Many fear freedom.   They don't want to blame themselves.   They shackle themselves to any master they can find.  Drugs, tyrants, the past.  They say:  ""I can't choose. I am not free.""  Yes, and why is that?"
A few words of encouragement can transform the trajectory of a life.
"Overnight success is almost invariably preceded by years of invisible and unrewarded hard work.   What about Zuckerberg? Spielberg?  Spielberg directed a homemade feature film at 15, doing all his own special effects.  Zuckerberg was building instant messaging programs at age 12."
It is best to attack the substance of an argument.   It is less good to attack the style of an argument.  It is pathetic to attack the identity of the arguer.
"It is easier for someone to give you advice if you distill your problem into a clear sentence.  Many expend effort for access to a hard to reach person and then nervously ramble. The listener can't identify the heart of the question, and addresses a tertiary point. Time runs out."
"Delusion can grow rapidly.   It devours individuals, institutions, societies.  The larger it grows, the more dangerous it feels to puncture it.   The blowup will hurt, but letting it go too far is fatal.  It is wise to deal with a delusion while it is still smaller than you."
I don't trust anyone else to summarize a book for me.   They will summarize what they took away from it.  Only I can summarize what I took away from it.
Highly efficient way to internalize a complex non-fiction book:  -Read on Kindle. -Highlight heavily. -Export highlights. -Edit down to core insights. -5-10 minutes of reading. -Keep that in cloud.  Can pull this up on any device and quickly recall my core takeaways.
"Virtue cannot be bought, but it can be sold.  Whatever the offer, it is too low."
"We know that good intentions do not guarantee good results.  True.  In fact, ""good intentions"" do not even guarantee good intentions.  Humans are very tempted to act out dark fantasies.  We hide it from others, and from ourselves.  What truly motivates you?  Is it good?   Is it?"
"A beautiful thought, though I fear it may not go that way at all..."
"This phase may pass, but in the meantime, you cannot afford to be naive.   Good luck.  Endure.  END OF THREAD"
"Those who are attempting to do anything risky, disruptive, or counter-intuitive will have to recognize this.  They will have to find ways to do their work in secret, or with the aid of patrons or tribes that can resist public pressure and intimidation."
"We have seen it happen over and over again.  A million users knifing a new Caesar every week.  The nature of our new networks facilitate this.  This is not just about ""outrage culture.""  This is about incentivizing conformity and punishing heresy.  This is fashion by fiat."
"All of this is the explanation for the extraordinary chill you feel, permeating the discourse.  It infects everything.  You've noticed it.  So much caution and blandness.  You see that the smartest people are the most affectedly bland of all.  They are afraid for good reason."
"Do not give concessions to the torch wielding mob.  Do not walk quietly to the guillotine.  You are in a war now, understand that.  Don't expect mercy from the usurpers."
"If you try to do anything important or risky, it is increasingly certain that you will attract this kind of attention. You must be ready for it.  An Athenian citizen would understand this. A Roman senator would understand this. An ambitious chimpanzee would understand this."
"REPUTATION: A THREAD  Your reputation is your life.  For the last few centuries of American life, you could, to some degree, start over. Move to a new city, a new state.  No more.  A torched reputation is now hard to survive.  If you attain prominence, people will try to end you."
Don't mistake a duel for a debate.  You can lose a debate and learn something.  Losing a duel will cost you more than your pride.  Don't bring a dull blade to a fight for your life.
"The past is a ghost in the room with you.  Ignoring it won't make it go away.  You can feel its breath on your neck.  Look at it.  Don't be afraid of it or seduced by it.  You must be able to look at it without living in it.  It is not the room, but it is part of the furniture."
Good provocation is virtuous truth seeking that shatters delusion.  Bad provocation is the fragile ego that deals with insecurity by lashing out.
"Arguments about facts should not be confused with arguments about priorities.  Both are essential, but they must be separated.  1. You must establish the facts.  2. You must have a discussion about how to prioritize and act on the facts.  If you start with 2, you corrupt 1."
"Plenty of reason to distrust ""big tech.""  Even more reason to distrust those readying to ""save us"" from big tech."
"How to improve public events: -Have a box on the ticket purchase/RSVP page. -Questions are written in that box. -The moderator reads best questions. -Chosen questioner gets swag.  Eliminating: -Monologues from questioners about childhood. -Request for selfies. -""Speaking as a..."""
Nothing makes me more grateful for my Twitter feed than trying to read publications I once enjoyed.  Like WIRED magazine.
"Nothing is free.  Will you pay with time, with money, with risk, with pain, with reputation?  Cowardice and inaction appear affordable in the short-term, but they are very expensive in the long-term."
Nothing attracts the vultures like a forced apology.
"""How do I get what I want?""  Replace that question with another:  ""How do I become the kind of person that can get the thing I want, and many other things?""  An improvement, but there is another question:  ""How do I endure getting what I want, and endure not getting what I want?"""
"How do some achieve what many desire? -They seek the best teachers. -They sacrifice. -They delay gratification. -They see the world as it is, not as they wish it to be. -They revise their theories. -They resist distraction. -They watch the right metrics. -They avoid costly drama."
"Now.  See now.  Feel now.  Touch now.  ""Before"" is gone.  ""Later"" never arrives.  You are adrift in the ocean of the now.  Less regret for ""before.""  Less anxiety about ""later.""  Now."
"The whispered reaction when someone says something brave and true:  ""I agree, though they didn't say it in the best way.""  Perhaps, but you didn't say it at all."
"A neutral observation on Donald Trump:  His skill is not in the stances he takes, but in the ones he provokes his enemies to take. -In favor of sitting for the anthem. -Against insulting Kim Jong Un. -Pro Rosie O'Donnell. -Defending the integrity of CNN.  They walk right into it."
Those with a little power tend to covet the spotlight.  Those with a lot of power tend to carefully avoid it.
No learning without humility.  No growth without pain.  No reward without risk.  No change without loss.  Embrace.  Endure.
Your past is a cage you imprison yourself in.  Remember you hold the key.
"The fruits of virtue ripen slowly, but their sweetness is unrivaled."
"A call to censorship is usually preceded by this statement:  ""This is beyond politics. This is about human decency.""  This can translated as: ""Offending your sacred values is fine."" ""Offending my sacred values is unacceptable.""  Truth surfaces chaotically.  Speech must be free."
"Fiction reveals general truths through specific untruths.  Few people in the world are Danes, yet a great many are Hamlet."
Communism is intelligent design for atheists.   It is the belief that society must have a designer.  This system of thought survives the most overwhelming counter evidence.   How is that possible?  Because it is really a religion that taps into very ancient conceptions of utopia.
"What culture triumphs?  The culture with the right combination of self-criticism and self-confidence.  A culture with delusional pride will run headlong into disaster.  A culture that despises itself will rot from the inside, becoming easy prey for motivated adversaries."
"If an institution is truly corrupt, they are likely to evolve sophisticated methods of crushing any critical ideas that emerge inside.  Internal correction may well be impossible.  Reform must be motivated by heavy public pressure that makes the institution fear for its future."
Run into obstacles or run through them.   You're running either way.
Your highest destiny won't be found under this rock or that rock.  It will be found at the top of the tower you use those rocks to construct.
Character is carved by the onslaught of adversity.
Nothing less than freedom.  Nothing less.
"A coalition built on universal principles can improve things.  A coalition built on identity quickly devolves into a contradiction.  Identity can (and will) be divided infinitely.  ""Victory"" will be followed by bloody fratricide in an inevitable war of infinite subtribes."
Most great writing was born as bad writing and then rewritten three times.
Inquiry without dogma.  Goodness without expectation.  Generosity without condescension.
A few good calls do not make you infallible.  Cultivate objectivity.  It is better to fall in love with the hard truth than to fall in love with your own hypothetical genius.
Subjecting everyone around you to constant purity tests is a good way to end up unhappy and widely disliked.
"Smart people get away with a lot of messiness, knowing their capacities will save them.  The most effective individuals are those rare smart people that develop habits and systems as smart as they are.  They don't compete with the field.  They try to reach their own limits."
"Increasingly, only the obsessed can resist the siren song of low-level distraction and ""entertainment"" that they're inundated with.   Obsessive interest makes deep attention not just possible, but impossible to turn off.  That has downsides, but produces stunning productivity."
"""I'm not informed on the topic, so I don't have an opinion.""  This statement tells me something valuable about the person saying it.  It bodes well for our future relationship."
"Imagine a school where they don't want you to learn.   Don't question, inquire, or speak out of turn.  Imagine a job that just isn't quite real.  Automated, redundant, and yet you're still here.  Imagine, imagine, it's not hard to do.  Front row seats for the start of the new."
"You can't say it, so you are discouraged from thinking it.  You can't think it, so you are discouraged from seeing it.  Restrictions on speech rapidly escalate into an attack on perception itself."
We are rapidly networking together every brain on the planet.  Nothing like this has ever happened.   It is without precedent.  The future will belong to those who grasp the significance of this and truly understand what animates the movements of the crowd.
"A false understanding of human nature will prove fatal in love, war, and marketing."
A good reputation is very hard to win and very easy to lose.
"Modern media pipeline:  -AP/Reuters does real reporting. -Major paper puts minor ideological slant on it. -23 year old intern at content farm puts outrageous ideological slant on it. -Celebrity tweets that link with insightful commentary like ""say what?!"" -200,000 retweets."
Ignorant celebrities are creating a toxic moral environment around vital issues.  Completely ignorant people are misleading millions of their followers.  Ignore the opinions of those who spend a great deal of time looking in the mirror and none at all looking at the facts.
"We have created a fragile and comfortable modern world in which things are much less likely to go slightly wrong, yet more likely to go catastrophically wrong.   The future offers up enormous opportunity and enormous existential risk."
"People lie all the time.  They will tell you they like this, or believe in that.  Mostly it is meaningless signalling.   Their bank statement is much more honest about their priorities and beliefs.  What will they lose something to acquire?  There you find the truth."
"Easy to criticize ""escapism.""   More interesting to identify just what people are trying to escape from.  To know what's missing from a person's life, look to their fantasies.  To see what needs are unfulfilled in a culture, look to its collective fantasies."
"The right deal is one that doesn't give away the farm, but doesn't give away the future relationship either.  Humans have a deep sense of reciprocity and fairness. An exploitative exchange is never forgotten, and subtle revenge is often exacted."
"Dependency is a smooth and well paved road that leads to decline, depression, and early death."
The suddenly prominent are usually surprised to find how few of their friendships were able to withstand the impact of meteoric success.  It is a rare individual that is truly happy to see a friend succeed.
"Saw Ready Player One, a film about a pseudonymous avatar inhabiting an increasingly totalitarian virtual environment and trying to inspire rebellion in his digital compatriots.  Finally, Hollywood represents me."
Whatever was.  Whatever is.  Whatever is coming.  Affirm.  Embrace.  Endure.
"If your central ethic revolves around not doing as you're told, you're likely to see authoritarian restrictions as more of an opportunity than a deterrent."
Most public events are dramatically more pleasurable if you leave before the Q&A starts.
Act more.  React less.
"It's loud, but is it real?"
"There is a certain combination of intelligence and cowardice that is hard to excuse.  Smart, comfortable, risk averse.  Comfortable because they're smart.  Risk averse because they're comfortable.  Cowardice grows consequences.  Less and less comfortable.  Not so smart after all."
Better to lose as a man than win as a eunuch.
Where will you find the virtuous man?  Drowned out by the clamor of the mob.  Awaiting the cup of hemlock.  Devoured by the fire.  Where will you find the virtuous man?  Alone.
"The public debate would go much more smoothly if people could properly parse the difference between ""this is 100% true"" and ""this is much more true than it is untrue."""
"When smart people resort to straw man arguments and character defamation, you should assume that they are afraid.  They sense they are going to lose and try to get their opponent disqualified on a technicality."
The best manipulators are nearly untraceable.   You'll re-examine your reasoning and think you made all your own choices.  They set up the board and left you to move the pieces.
Subjective personal experience makes for great art and bad argument.
"There is a creeping totalitarianism in this recent trend of condemning people for ""crimes of association.""  No one (particularly in the internet age) knows or endorses all viewpoints held by their associates.  Do not let anyone tell you who you can and cannot be friends with."
"The best thing about consistent reading is that it takes the pressure off each individual book.  If reading is a daily habit, then a single deep insight makes a book well worth it.  On to the next one."
It is not about the goal.  It is about becoming the person who can achieve the goal.  That person will be able to achieve many other goals.  This isn't about a prize.  This is about becoming a prizefighter.
"""Free trial. New streaming service. 30 days free.""  30 days of time given to something that isn't worth paying for.  Not free."
"20 years of being told where to stand, what to think, how to talk.  Finished. Free.   Free to stand where they want, think what they want, talk how they want.  Panic. Uncertainty. Is anyone in charge?  They search for an authority and plead:  ""Please sir, tell me where to stand."""
Better to pay for virtue than profit from vice.
"Odd cultural practices often originate as attempts to solve a real problem.  They became incoherent when still applied after the problem is gone.  Like medicine for a disease you don't have.   All side effects, no cure.  What is rational in one setting becomes madness in another."
People rarely respect those who slavishly pander and defer to them.  They see weakness and despise it.
Make your ideals worth carving into marble.
"Human nature is a reality.  Evolution has endowed us with a specific operating system.  Our software operates under certain constraints.   You can force very unnatural behaviors, but your ""solutions"" will be unstable.  The further you push, the more dramatic the swing backwards."
Note when your attention drifts.  Note what it drifts to.  Identify what you find instinctively captivating.  This may be valuable information about what you are capable of focusing deeply on.
"Truth hurts, but self-deception is fatal."
"We reach.  We reach for the stones.   To build. To break. To make fire.  We reach for truth and meaning.  For cross, for book, for marble.  We reach for what is above.  For future, flight, and star.  We reach."
"Personal computers.  A wave of innovation.  The internet.  A wave of innovation.  Maybe you're young. Maybe you were busy.   Either way, you likely missed those waves.  There are about five waves gathering strength and speed right now.  They are real.  Catch them if you can."
"Trench warfare is always tempting.  They are entrenched, so why not dig in and fight?  Sometimes you have to.  Often, you can simply go around them.  Do you want to live in a trench?"
Many who say they seek freedom are only trying to shackle themselves to new masters.  Enslaved by desire. Captive to opinion.  To the news cycle.  To the narrative.  Freedom is in mastery of self.  Freedom can embrace.  Freedom can endure.
Social media and 24 hour news has made long term thinking very hard for people.  They are fooled by short term metrics.  The most valuable things in life and business must be given time to evolve.  Identify what is real and practice patience.
Control your reactions or they will control you.
Entering the public sphere will attract enemies.  Watch for the words your opponents try to tag you with.  They may be subtle and suggestive rather than outright defamatory.  The intention is to isolate you and make you untouchable.  Don't play unwinnable games.   Don't be naive.
Political correctness is the art of making five sentences out of what should be one.
If you do not have any specific aim no one can see you fail specifically.  True.  They'll just watch you fail generally as your potential gradually fades.
You don't have to do what other people tell you to do if you can consistently do what you tell yourself to do.  Easier said than done.
"A starving peasant, a teenage anorexic, an ascetic seeking enlightenment.  All are hungry. They are in the same state of deprivation.  Yet, it is not the same.   Experience is shaped by emotion, desire, purpose.  Fate has adversity in store for you.  How will you rise to meet it?"
You can't learn what you won't admit you don't know.
"An argument with a lover.  ""You"" want to win.   But if ""you"" win, ""we"" lose.  If ""you"" lose, ""we"" lose.  It is best if ""you"" do not lose.  It is best if ""you"" do not win.  It is best if ""we"" win."
Are you anxious about everyday social interactions?  You should recognize that most people are far more concerned with their performance than yours.  They are dueling with their own insecurities.  They're not thinking about you at all.
How do you profit off healthy people?  Convince them they are sick.  How do you profit off happy people?  Convince them they are unhappy.  How do you profit off smart people?  Convince them they are ignorant.  How do you profit off wise people?  Good luck.
Speech is not violence.  Speech is negotiation.  Negotiation is how violence is avoided.
The narrative is a fragile hallucination.  Hear everything. Hear nothing.  See everything. See nothing.  Learn to see only darkness.  Learn to hear only silence.  Then try to look again.  Then try to hear again.  Filter out the noise.   Identify the real.
Your attention has economic value.  Withdraw your attention from things you do not wish to make more of.
"Some people trigger instinctive alarm.  You can't describe it, but you know it when you feel it.  Ignore that intuition at your peril."
Easier to blame than change.  Easier to resent than reform.
Don't live in a manner that makes you despise being alone with yourself.
Be wary if you find that what was recently a banal observation is suddenly an unspeakable heresy.
History is now generally written by the losers.
Do not waste your life taking revenge on the shadows of those you cannot forget or forgive.  Accept.  Endure.
Many inexplicable fashions and subcultures make sense if you see them as personal branding to signal to equivalent mates.   The ambitious will advertise that they seek an interaction with mutually high expectations.  The unambitious will signal that you shouldn't expect too much.
Never do anything you'll lie to yourself about later.
"It is good to have a goal, but bad to let your goal have you.  Focus is good, but focus that is too narrow becomes blindness."
"Empathize with your enemy enough to understand them, but not enough to apologize for them.  You should be able to explain their actions, but you should not explain them away.  Don't blind yourself to the truth of their intentions."
"This last month has been a surprise.  17K followers in 28 days.  For the sake of clarity, this account will be renamed to just ""The Stoic Emperor.""  So don't unfollow the artist formerly known as Marcus Aurelius unless you've truly had your fill of cryptic philosophical musings."
"A professor visits a Zen master, seeking wisdom.   The professor has many opinions.  He tells of all he has learned about Zen.  The master smiles.  He pours hot water into a cup of tea.  It overflows.  ""This is your mind. Very full.""  The master keeps pouring.  ""No room for Zen."""
There was a future once.  Coming so fast we couldn't keep up.  It hit a roadblock.  Near annihilation.  The future decelerated.  We fell into the dream.  False stability. Incremental change.  A comforting illusion.  The dream is ending.  Awake.   The future is accelerating again.
Accept the success. Why should it be otherwise? Accept the suffering. Why should it be otherwise? Accept the love. Why should it be otherwise? Accept the loss. Why should it be otherwise? Accept the joy. Why should it be otherwise? Accept the end. Why should it be otherwise?
"Are contrarians punished? Even when they are right?  Depends on the timescale.  In the short term, contrarians are despised for questioning the consensus.  In the long term they may acquire priceless reputations for prophecy as bubbles of delusion burst and risky bets pay off."
"To say that ""time is money"" is a grotesque undervaluation of time.  You can lose a fortune and make another one.   Lost time is irretrievable.  Do not trade time for trifles."
Why do people often shrink from opportunities they claim to desire?  They are intimidated by the prospect of change.   Success would be a change.  Thus they choose stable sameness over uncomfortable progress.
Revenge is a desire that very effectively motivates you to work productively towards a catastrophic outcome.
If you're overwhelmed by constant anxiety: -Schedule when you'll deal with a problem. -Focus deeply at the scheduled time. -Forbid yourself from obsessing over it at other times.  -Bring your attention to the present if you find yourself problem solving as a background process.
"Modern humans overdose on information, pushing the limits of our design constraints.  Future humans will adopt filtering mechanisms to avoid drowning in random data.  They'll look back on us with pity.  Attention pollution is a huge drain on our collective intellectual resources."
"Why does he smile when misfortune strikes?  He knows it is an opportunity to cultivate virtue.  Death, loss, decline.   These things come for us all.  Facing pain is how we make ready.  Adversity sharpens the blade of will.  Greet the test gladly.  Endure."
"People love democracy until they start losing.  Suddenly it is ""chaotic,"" ""unstable,"" hostage to ""low information voters."""
"Telling hard truths causes friction in the short term, but earns respect for the long term.  Flattery will get you ahead in the short term, but harm you in the long run.  People resent their enablers when they face the costs of their delusions."
The most valuable thing in the modern world is information. Almost all information can be acquired for free if you dutifully seek it out.  The rate of change is rapidly increasing. Those who cannot adapt will struggle.  Agile lifelong learners will do very well.
"We try to impress others. Obviously.  Yet often we are really trying to please our own projection of the social group we once belonged to.  Friends from childhood, harsh professors.  People we never see. People who don't think about us.  We're trying to appease an imaginary jury."
Many culture wars currently raging are largely contrived.  How do you provoke a fake culture war? -Identify sacred values of a group. -Repeatedly suggest bad actors are violating them. -Urge group to combat illusory bad actors.  Do it with many groups at once for total chaos.
Many spend countless hours on their social media feed.  Most spend very little time carefully choosing who to follow.  Self-promoting celebrities? Insincere politicians?  Your mind is reverberating with the voices of those you allow into it.
What are values worth?   When will you find out? -When the bull market ends. -When your health starts to fail. -When your kids are old enough to ignore you. -When you need someone to talk you off the ledge.  Life is long and full of choices.  Your values will catch up with you.
"An insidious trend in pseudo-journalism:  ""People are outraged!""  Where?  ""These tweets we embedded.""   Playbook: -Contrive a narrative -Find five tweets that support it -Publish -Hope that will generate organic behavior -Write a 2nd story covering what you provoked -Ad revenue"
"Virtue is shown through action, not opinion."
"Where is the next big thing?  Where you find true depth of conviction.  Impulsive crowds will circle anything, creating ""noise."" The future is not built on noise.  It is built where a new person becomes a true believer each day.   Believers convert the impulsive crowd one by one."
Sharing your life with the right person will double your impact. Sharing your life with the wrong person will halve it. The right person will shore up your weaknesses.  The wrong person will encourage them.
Wicked policies are usually cloaked in a veil of false altruism.  You have to learn to identify the realpolitik that is buried in the platitudes.  Ask: -What resources are being redistributed? -Who is employed in the implementation? -What is the intellectual origin of the scheme?
"The trending topics sidebar on Facebook is mass psychological abuse.  Hyperbolic fear-mongering ""news"" next to the faces of your family.  Trending topics on Twitter is not much better.  My Twitter location is set to Busan Korea. I see what's trending there.  I can't read Korean."
Why criticize college? -All are unthinkingly tracked towards it by parents and educators.  -Costs grew 1000% in 30 years. The returns have not. -Government pays for loans that entrap vulnerable youth. -Youth are less dynamic. Can't take risks because they have onerous loans.
"What is college for?  To turn you into them.  To give you a mortgage, but no house.  To lock you away while you miss the next wave.  To pay administrative salaries.  To exploit adjunct professors.  To advance unpopular ideologies.  To produce good doctors that most can't afford."
What is next?  No one knows.  What is now?   No one sees.   Too busy looking for what's next.
Was asked how a young person can impress an experienced boss: -Devour all the books they don't have time to read.  -Become an expert on their enemies. Mention weaknesses you see. -Admit ignorance when you are out of your depth. -Be available when someone else fails.
What part of you wants it?  Should you indulge that part of you?   Should you starve it?  Know the answer before you let desire take the reins.
Slogans are not stances. Rhetoric is not reality.   Be wary of movements heavy on emotion and light on conceptual clarity.
Internet memes.  Memes are ways of signalling shared knowledge.  Memes are symbols of tribal affiliation.  Memes provide a symbolic backdrop that imposes context on disorder.  Memes move the consensus.  This is deep and ancient power.  Continually underestimated.
Most who occupy future positions of power will go through the university system.  Dogmas in the university system will have very broad impact on the future of all our institutions.  The protests (which occur reliably) are the product of an ideology that is standard and enforced.
Don't burn your future on the altar of the past.  Remember it. Don't live in it. Learn the lesson.  The past is fixed. The future is variable.  You will transform. You will endure.
"Why are many smart people so bland on social media?  Why are many ""personal brands"" so impersonal?   They are trying to balance being interesting and being employable.   This is now almost impossible.  The internet rewards risk and controversy.   Institutions see only liability."
"Words are curious things.  Speakers of uncomfortable truths we shall call ""provocateurs.""  Well disguised social engineering we shall call ""nudging.""  AI that does not kill us we shall call ""machine learning.""  Empirical facts we shall call ""just another perspective."""
They see the set of priorities that they are optimized for.  You see the set of priorities that you are optimized for.  It is likely that both approaches have real utility.  You will never fully agree and merge into one.  This is a hardware problem.  Social life is a negotiation.
Where will the new Athens be?  Here.   Now.  Hiding in the white noise.  Flowing through the network.  Wherever the truth is spoken.
"What are you afraid of?  Are you afraid they'll take everything away from you?  Can they take everything away from you?  Yes, but only if you value the kind of things that can be taken.  Honor. Purpose. Virtue. Truth.  These cannot be taken.   They can only be given away."
"Real risk is something that you might lose friends or money over.  Many are praised for saying ""brave"" or ""controversial"" things that everyone in their in-group already agrees with. No risk.  Being courageous singles you out as an individual.  Being a coward will help you fit in."
"The implicit demand behind much ambient social pressure:  ""You must signal deference to our hierarchy of priorities.""  It is hard to remain polite without validating the narrative.  This is how you end up conscripted into something dangerous.  You signal assent to avoid conflict."
Think well to write well.  Write well to think well.  Clean writing is clear thinking.  Unclear writing is usually the product of unclear thinking.
"You cannot win a debate by suppressing it.  Your opponents will disguise themselves, not disappear.  The persecution gives them allure and makes you look weak.  You deny yourself the ability to hear their strategy and concerns.  Censorship begets frailty, not safety."
Those who risk seeing.  Those who risk thinking.  Those who who risk building.  Those who risk climbing higher.  Those who risk being targeted.  Those who risk.  Don't stop.  Endure.
Actors are people that are paid to unblinkingly accept the gaze of a camera and convince you of things that aren't true.  Actors are people who make an art of sounding believable saying things that they don't understand or believe.  Actors deceive. That is what they are for.
Some conspiracy theories are true. Most are not.   They are usually reactions against complexity.  Real world is full of multivariate problems that are hard to tackle.  Conspiracy theories usually reduce problems to single causes with a moral shading flattering to the believer.
"For user experience, I prefer print books.  For note-taking, I prefer Kindle books.  For ritualistic contemplation, I prefer audiobooks.  Books are generally much better reading than articles.  Most journalism is ephemera with no long-term value."
"If the world was full of only love and kindness there would be no philosophy.  We would not need it.  Yet we suffer. We are limited.   If you are experiencing only love and kindness, enjoy it fully.   It will not last.   Suffering will return, and philosophy will be needed."
"Debate is now largely impossible.  Most do not listen to arguments.  They listen for signals of shared affiliation.  If they get the right signals, they listen.  If they get the wrong signals, they object.  Argument without signalling is something they can't interpret at all."
The faintest spark can reignite the torch of virtue.
Life is full of suffering.  Yes.  Why should it be otherwise?  Embrace. Endure.
Establishment braintrust has just caught up with the organic online culture of about five years ago.  They don't see how fast the currents of the cultural ocean are now shifting.  The younger generation will turn out very differently than expected.  Don't believe the narrative.
Insults and irony are often crutches for the cynical and reactionary.  It is easy to attack those who are taking risks or building something.  Just don't be jealous when their risks pay off.  Don't be upset if you aren't invited into the castle they've built.
A culture of contrived virality is increasingly embraced by corporations that desperately seek to provoke and harness random attention.  This tends to lead to pathetic posturing and embarrassing errors.  The future is not built on fads.  The future is built by true believers.
"Why does the captain go down with the ship?  The captain is the ship.  If he is not the ship, he is not the captain.  He is merely impersonating one.  True leaders take ultimate responsibility."
"Corporate marketers are desperately aiming for viral Tumblr glory.  As always, they are about three years behind the curve."
Peace and quiet makes room for real contemplation.  Contemplation allows the truth to emerge.  Facing the truth would force us to transform.  This is why we detest peace and quiet.  This is why we sacrifice every quiet moment to trivial distraction.
"""This will really get back at them.""  ""This will show them what I'm made of.""  Write down exactly what you intend to do.   Write down how you intend to make them pay.  Put it in a drawer. Do nothing.  Read it after 24 hours.   Again after 48.  Do you still desire to do it?"
Is that the real reason?  Or is it the explanation you'd prefer other people believe?  You probably should not try to fool them.  You certainly should not try to fool yourself.
"Know what is.  Know what should be.  Devise the system of behavior most likely to lead to what should be.  Act.  Detach emotion from outcome.  Derive satisfaction from the action, not the result."
Don't sacrifice the present by dreaming of the hypothetically perfect future.  Don't sacrifice the present by obsessing over a nostalgically distorted past.  Today is yesterday's hypothetically perfect future.  Today is tomorrow's nostalgically distorted past.
"People are easier to understand once you grasp that most speech is about signalling, not sensemaking."
Highly effective individuals don't necessarily see more. They often see less.  They've cultivated filtering mechanisms that allow them to quickly focus in on the relevant information and exclude the white noise.  The wood texture of the door is irrelevant.   See the handle.
"Many young people are obsessed with ""identity.""  They're asking a good question in the worst way.  They only see ""identity"" in its least interesting facets.  This is a multi-layered question.  They got stuck in the top layer: politics.   Underneath is the right layer: philosophy."
Individuation is vulnerability.  We fear being targeted. We seek shelter among the herd.  Social media was created so we could express individuality.  This induces existential terror.  What if they find out we're not like them?  Created for individuals.   Can't seem to find many.
"""Give me your opinion. Tell me. Be honest.""  I tell you. I am honest.  ""Who asked you? What gives you the right to have an opinion?""  Some people are seeking the truth. They want to understand.  Many are seeking validation. They want to affirm what they already are."
"The price of entry to the tribe is the willingness to signal deference to their set of taboos.  Concepts of the sacred and profane must become arbitrary and political.  ""We"" see it this way. ""We"" do it that way.  ""We"" shrink from virtue.  Only ""I"" can find virtue."
"Language evolves in an organic manner.  Language evolves from the bottom up.  Top down attempts to control language are totalitarian. Always.  If you want to find the bad guys, look for the people who are telling you what you can't say."
"We could learn the lesson.  Or we could act out a drama.  Noise, shouting, blame.  Action. Heart rates rising.  It feels like something is happening.  It feels like progress or change.  No progress. No change.  We chose the drama over the lesson."
"If our conception of the world remains intact, we aren't forced to dedicate cognitive and emotional resources to revising our map of the territory.   It would throw us into turmoil, making it hard to follow our schedule.   We substitute consensus for thinking and punish heretics."
"If a fight is unnecessary, avoid the fight. It will tire you and make you vulnerable.  If a fight is necessary, seek total victory. Settle the matter.  One must learn to distinguish between real threats and mere annoyances."
"Some people simply want a reaction.  They detest peace and stability.  When you reject them, they try to seduce you with good behavior.  If you forgive them, they set about trying to alienate you again.  Positive or negative, all they seek is attention.  Don't give it to them."
Ask:  -What game am I being asked to play?  -Am I being set up to fail?  You're being pushed towards various games.  Many are rigged. Often quite obviously.  They smile as they sharpen the axe.  Positive-sum games are best.  Are you in a zero-sum game?  Quit or win.   Don't lose.
Be quiet. Be good. Don't talk back in class.  Stop building so much. Stop running so fast.  Please extinguish your torch. Please turn off your light.  You're outshining the others. It's really not nice.  Stop building. Stop running.  Don't make us ask twice.
Courage is a muscle that is grown through action.  Bravery begets boldness.  Inaction saps your resolve. It breeds timidity.  Don't fear.  Act.
"When you access social media, email, or the news, you enable the voices of all of humanity to compete to set your agenda.   These voices take up significant mental real estate. They make it hard to hear your own thinking.  Be vigilant about guarding your own cognitive resources."
Contempt for the past is contempt for the future.  History will tell you what we're like.  History will tell you what we'll do.
These words came into my mind as I tried to sleep.  I was thinking about political systems and human nature.  I was thinking about Venezuela.
More makes more and less makes less.  So unfair. So unjust.  Surely we can make less make more.  Surely we can make more make less.  So easily we break what makes.  Now all make less. Now none make more.  We can't eat fair. We can't eat just.  Go to bed hungry. Dream of more.
"Adversity. Struggle. Alone and unseen.  This too, I shall endure.  Sudden disaster. Loss and despair.  This too, I shall endure.  Getting what I wanted. All things are well.  This too, I shall endure."
"King for a day, on display.  Paraded, saluted, supreme.  Fading, failing, wrapped in linen.  Entombed in stone that reaches for heaven.  Buried by rubble. Swallowed by sand.  Unearthed. Unwrapped.  In a glass case. Special exhibition.  King for a day, on display."
Almost all Americans own a smartphone or a computer.  Each device contains the library of Alexandria.   The sum total of all world knowledge.   You can learn anything. Why don't you?  Too busy tracking social status.   Too enthralled by imagery your evolution can't resist.
"On your deathbed, looking back fondly on all the TV you binge-watched.  Not likely."
It will be found on the other side of the fire.  The flames are hot.  Hot enough to burn. Hot enough to refine.  Endure.
Don't fear. Prepare.  Don't fear. Learn.  Don't fear. Build.  Don't fear. Endure.
The complacent awoke to find themselves falling.  Falling back into history.  Back into the realm of danger and opportunity.  Back into a story with no author.  How will it end?
"A pirate ship, shot full of holes. The captain hangs from the rigging.   Sinking.  The pirates don't seem to notice. They are trying to redistribute the treasure in the hold. Each agitates for more.  The water is up to their knees.  Reflected gold shines in their wide open eyes."
"Tradition is the set of behaviors and beliefs that enabled survival across time.  Tradition is a ""good enough"" solution. It is not ideal, but it is unlikely to produce catastrophe.  Tradition must evolve, but with great caution.   Do not dismantle what you do not yet understand."
"The idea of cultural appropriation is not valid.  Culture is appropriation. That is all that culture is.  Appropriation from your neighbor, your mother, that man in the market.  Appropriation from those who came before, the builders, the remembered.  Civilization is open source."
"HR culture is no substitute for morality.  Morality is not about fear of authority.  Morality is about not doing things you could get away with.  Morality is cultivated, not enforced.  It is made in the home and it radiates outward.  No home, no morality. No morality, no society."
Reading is not a chore.  Reading is theft. It is a robbery.  Someone smarter than you has spent 20 years beating their head against the wall trying to solve the problem you're dealing with.  You can steal that hard won knowledge and make it yours.  That is power.
What do I want for you?  I want what you want when your mind isn't clouded.  I want what you want when you really see.  I want the highest part of you to flourish.
Bureaucracies tend to focus primarily on perpetuating their own existence.  They have a stated purpose but their real function is to keep their employees employed.  Incompetence and abuse should not surprise you. They are the norm.  Be wary. Retain sovereignty over your life.
"Time is as valuable as we make it.   A year spent in idleness and self-obsession will be worthless.   A day spent in active process, in learning, enjoying the present, embracing the inevitable... one such day may be priceless.  What a sort of day shall this be? What sort of year?"
Most people prefer complaining to learning.  They blame others. They blame society. They blame existence itself.  They refuse to track the chain of behavior that led them to this outcome.  See. Learn. Transform. Endure.
Begin by asking:  - Who is it that is setting my agenda?  - Is that agenda in accordance with my beliefs?  - Am I applying an active process to the pursuit of my agenda?  - Do I have metrics to track my results?  - Am I concerning myself only with that which is within my control?
It is fruitless to look back and wish you had used your time differently.   That kind of narcissism was what wasted so much time in the first place.  Learn your lesson. Don't wallow. Don't relive the past.  Turn your attention to the present.
"Meritocracy moves.  Kill the meritocratic element of an institution and you kill the institution, but not the meritocracy. It will reform intact outside the walls, as ""experts"" are blindsided by the sudden death of the recently invincible incumbent.  Meritocracy moves. Follow it."
Note my heroism as I stand up to someone everyone in my social circle despises.  This isn't about signalling to my politically homogeneous in-group.  This is about what's right. I'm a real hero.
"Nerdy ultra specialization is tolerated, but general truths are unspeakable.  You can show a leaf accurately, but don't you dare show the whole tree.  Or worse, the whole forest."
Planning and routinization offers insurance against future moodiness and inconsistency.  Outsource the set of mundane daily decisions to a clear set of principles.  Don't waste your cognitive powers on the banal and repetitious.   Make space for innovative thought.
"Silence seems safe, but beware of swallowing your words too often.  One day you'll choke on them."
Why do they deceive you?   Because it is so easy.
"This is what is wrong with the modern mainstream left. They aren't extremists, but they're unwilling to stand up to them so they are dominated and become pawns.   They can't be distinguished from the extremists because they linguistically signal to them and won't draw red lines."
"People ask for advice.   ""Give it to me straight. Tell me the truth.""  Rarely honest. Usually they want it curved. Usually they want a lie.  People rarely want to transform.  They want you to validate their identity.  They want you to enable their stasis."
"""I don't read.""  But you are reading this. And those street signs, and those porn video titles, and those messages you can't bring yourself to delete.  Your mind is overfull with words. They could be better words."
MOVIE REVIEW:  Noise and light. Too much noise. Too much light.  So little to see. So little to hear.  Leave the speakers off. Leave the room dark.  Now I see. Now I hear.
Don't be optimistic. Don't be pessimistic.   See it. See what it is. See through it.
"Beware the headline that claims a false consensus:  ""We all love...""  ""We're all shocked..."" ""What you need..."" ""You'll cry when you see...""  You're no longer a reader. You're a conscript, being taught to react.  Taught to look through a clouded lens and see only the narrative."
A hundred years to build a cathedral.   An hour with a wrecking ball to destroy it.
"Society spins into chaos when virtue becomes vice and vice becomes virtue.  The virtuous will be found among the outcasts, the defamed, the reviled."
"We're evolved from lowly animals.  Christian Right: Stop saying that.  Sorry we are.  The Left: Yes. Please continue.  This has serious implications for human society.  The Left: Wait, stop saying that."
Don't like the culture? It lives off your dollars and your attention. Give it nothing. Bleed it dry.   Build something better.
"""Intellectuals are more totalitarian in outlook than the common people. Most of them are perfectly ready for dictatorial methods, secret police, systematic falsification of history etc. so long as they feel that it is on ‘our’ side.""  - George Orwell"
What do you mean?
"Outraged agreement and outraged disagreement both produce clicks. Digital metrics have stoked the fire of this to a considerable degree. Gawker perfected this practice, and now most mainstream outlets have followed."
Look at those who do wrong. Grapple with why it is so tempting. Think how much you'd like to do the wrong you're not doing. Fully conceptualize just how much you'd enjoy it. Understand entirely. Then don't do it.
Inquiry uncorrupted by dogma.
Plot twist: YouTube saves Western civilization.
"California's continued success is the result of network effects (Silicon Valley, Hollywood). The local governance has been disastrous for decades."
"We must consider who we are allowing to set the terms of the conversation, and what underlying assumptions we are agreeing to operate by in doing so.   What master are we serving? Why do we allow others to modulate our thoughts and emotions so easily?"
"We are careful who we invite into our home, but careless about allowing the voices of mobs and advertisers into our minds. They make for bad house guests."
"Wisdom is what is needed, and wisdom is work. Work at wisdom every day, whether you're in a mansion or a gutter. Learn. Transform. Endure."
"“Without education, we are in a horrible and deadly danger of taking educated people seriously.” - G.K. Chesterton"
Do you watch TV? Weekly? Daily? Yes? Then you have the time to do that thing you're not doing.
"Search after truth is peculiar to man. When we have leisure, we are eager to see, to hear, to learn. We esteem a desire to know. - Cicero"
