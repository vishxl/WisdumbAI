It‚Äôs only the misfits who have a chance.
Subtract incentives from advice.

Hacking Elon‚Äôs Twitter account and using it for a crypto scam rather than a stock-trading scam shows a complete lack of imagination.
Most companies building AGI will end up trading stocks instead.

Well said.
"I, and I alone, am responsible for everything I think and feel."
"Take feedback from nature and markets, not from people."
Optimists thrive but pessimists survive.
We‚Äôre watching the establishment pull out all the stops to take back the Presidency.
No need for conspiracies when incentives do the job better.
‚ÄúGuided by Science‚Äù is the new ‚ÄúListen to your Parents.‚Äù
The San Francisco body politic is obese and won‚Äôt survive a famine.
"Just as Hiroshima ushered in the nuclear age, COVID19 ushers in the biological age."

The biggest advantage of working remotely is that you no longer have to pretend to work 60 hours a week.
Thank you.
"Build something worthwhile and they will come.   The co-founders, the investors, the mentors. All of them."
"Status games are multiplayer, zero-sum, hierarchical, judged socially.   Get grades, applause, titles now - emptiness later.  Natural games are single player, positive-sum, internal, judged by nature/markets.   Pay in pain now - get wealth, health, knowledge, peace, family later."
"Cola has no ‚Äútaste memory.‚Äù For an addict, it can replace water entirely.  Social media has infinite variation. For an addict, it can replace learning entirely.  Porn can replace sex. Games can replace careers. Sugar can replace nutrition. Drugs can replace motivation.  Entirely."
"Physical monopolies (phone company, electric utility) aggregate supply and raise prices.   They underpay for demand and make excess profits.  Digital monopsonies (search engine, social network) aggregate demand and lower prices.   They underpay for supply and make excess profits."

"Either we agree on how to measure it, or it becomes politics."
Pointing out mental disorders is a mental disorder. ü§îüß†
Yelling at strangers that you will never meet is a mental disorder.
The people who think I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a conspiracy are the real conspiracy theorists.
"If you wanted to boost tech adoption and media consumption, you couldn‚Äôt come up with a better scheme than placing everyone under house arrest."
You don‚Äôt want to have to be in a specific place at a specific time.
The lockdowns are intensely pro-tech.   They forcibly accelerate tech adoption and cure the industry of its collective addiction to industrial-era offices.
"If you are the hero in the story of your life, realize that the best books and movies aren‚Äôt the longest books and movies."
"Political correctness makes speech itself political, and so everything becomes political."
Technology destroys jobs and replaces them with opportunities.
A true atheist knows that nothing ultimately matters and lives a relatively carefree life.   A true believer knows that it‚Äôs all in God‚Äôs hands and lives a relatively carefree life.   Lot of agnostics out there.

You cannot fail at meditation.
"There is nothing to say and nothing on offer. No one is taking you anywhere, selling you anything, or making you promises. Reading or talking about meditation will do nothing for you."
"The point of meditation is not to become ""a meditator"" - in reality, there's no such thing. If it doesn‚Äôt bring lasting and effortless change, drop it, before it becomes another struggle and another chase."
"If meditation was easy, you‚Äôd do nothing else."
Meditation is a single player game. There is no point in comparing to other meditators or to even your own previous meditations.
"There's no need to get up to record a thought. If the idea was good, it‚Äôll come back. If it doesn‚Äôt come back, it wasn‚Äôt that good."
"There are many meditation methods, but ""no effort"" is the universal method. Every creature at all times can choose to do nothing."
"No focus, no mantra, no dharma, no chakras, no Buddhas, no gurus, no gratitude, no scripture, no temple, no music, no gadgets, no apps are required.   Some may be helpful, but eventually all will have to be left behind. Start simply, because that's where this all ends."
Meditation isn‚Äôt holy or spiritual or magical. It‚Äôs literally nothing.
Meditation is not going through thoughts but rather letting thoughts go through you.  The thought ‚ÄúI am meditating‚Äù is also a thought.
"Make no effort for or against anything.   Whatever happens, happens.   Surrender to yourself in the moment.   Resist nothing and reject nothing, including the urge to resist and reject."
"Realize that at this moment, you are the only person in the world and there is no one to instruct you, praise you, or judge you."
"Sixty minutes are easier than thirty, as it takes time for the mind to settle down.  Sixty consecutive days are needed, just as it takes time for the body to go from unfit to fit."
"Prepare for meditation by sitting quietly in the morning, with eyes closed and back upright, in any comfortable position that will minimize movement."
"Just as the sky rains when the clouds are heavy, and the body sleeps when the limbs are tired, meditation arrives when the mind is calm."
"Just as the sky rains when the clouds are heavy, and the body sleeps when the limbs are tired, meditation arrives when the mind is calm."
"In an age of mental gluttony, meditation is fasting for the mind.  Before paying a therapist to listen to you, listen to yourself.  Before clearing your inbox, clear your mind."
"All chases, whether flow, drugs, beauty, thrills, orgasm, or devotion, are attempts to escape from the mind.   Meditation is the direct path."
‚ÄúNo technique of the mind will free you from the mind.‚Äù
We say that we want peace of mind but what we really want is peace from mind.
"Meditation is your birthright. It's your natural state.  It requires no one, needs no thing, and has no technique.  If something requires a guru, a mantra, or a teaching, it isn't universal, and it won't free you."

The modern caste system is built around the university diploma.

Choosing happiness doesn‚Äôt make anyone else worse off.
Victim mentality makes it harder.
"Get wealthy, get healthy, get happy."
The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.
Do it. Glad I could inspire.
I‚Äôm not enlightened and I wasn‚Äôt depressed.
"Just like a low resting heart rate is the byproduct of intense exercise, low anxiety is the byproduct of intense self-examination."
"Let‚Äôs evaluate each individual and statement on their own merits, not in lazy groupings."
"All models rely on a small set of critical assumptions.   A good (simple) model uncovers them, while a bad (complicated) model obscures them."
Politicizing science is the same as destroying it.
You‚Äôre never going to be happy if you keep lying to yourself.
"If you can‚Äôt tell, does it really matter?"
Wisdom is the product of experience and honest reflection.
"Wisdom can‚Äôt be copied, it must be embodied."

The only people worth envying are the ones incapable of envy.

"Once you‚Äôre calm and fit, you have everything worth having, as the rest just comes and goes."
The two biggest investing mistakes are panic buying and panic selling.
Young children are at their most mesmerizing when they aren‚Äôt self-conscious at all.
"Colleges have to convince students for the next year that a remote education is worth every bit as much as an in-person one, and then pivot back before students actually start believing it.  It‚Äôs like only being able to sell your  competitor‚Äôs product for a year."
You build a model to figure out which assumptions drive the model.
"When the mind is speaking without permission, it‚Äôs lying."
It‚Äôs how a society identifies ‚Äúcool‚Äù people - rulebreakers that we secretly admire.
Love is what remains when all other emotions are gone.
"Envy is an illusion.   The part of the person that we envy doesn‚Äôt exist without the rest of that person.   If we aren‚Äôt willing to trade places with them completely - their life, their body, their thoughts - then there is nothing to be envious about."
"Billionaires aren‚Äôt evil, they‚Äôre just boring."
"You‚Äôre in the minority, my friend."
Half of us are working from couch and luxuriating in the myth of shared sacrifice.   The other half are getting their livelihoods crushed while the virus lies in wait.
Lockdown is rehab for society to break its addiction to unnecessary commuting for unnecessary meetings.

"Neo: If I have to choose between the Blank Room and the Matrix, I choose the Matrix.  Morpheus: Rest, Neo. Here is a world to pull over your eyes and to blind you from the truth.  Good night, Mr. Anderson."

"Neo: It would have infinite power and intelligence, to render all the other sims.  Being perfect and complete, it would itself appear without opposites."
Neo: The top level. The Root sim. No more secrets.  Morpheus: How would you even know?
Morpheus: I can't prove to you that this isn't a simulation.  Neo: Then show me how deep the rabbit hole goes.  <Morpheus shuffles around. A bag of red pills emerges.>  Morpheus: Which sim do you want?
"Neo: No, I mean let me out of Zion. To the truth. Give me the real red pill.  Morpheus: You took the red pill, you're in Wonderland.  Neo: I still have a splinter in my mind. How do I know that this isn't a simulation?"
"Morpheus: The year is 2199. Welcome...to the desert of the real. The last human city. Zion.  Neo: No. Stop. Let me out. I want out.  Morpheus: I didn‚Äôt say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth."
"Morpheus: Wake up Neo, the Matrix has you.  You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.  Neo: I have to see it for myself.  <reaches for the red pill.>"

"Fast, lift, sprint, stretch, and meditate.  Build, sell, write, create, invest, and own.  Read, reflect, love, seek truth, and ignore society.  Make these habits. Say no to everything else.  Avoid debt, jail, addiction, disgrace, shortcuts, and media.  Relax. Victory is assured."

Not going to be delayed. Media is click baiting you.

"To be fair, all serology tests, if biased, would bias the same way. When the actual percent infected is low and population samples are small, false positives will have an outsized impact compared to false negatives. But none of these shows less than a 10x undercount."
"Recent serology studies may be wrong. But if wrong, they‚Äòre all wrong *in the same direction.*  Finnish: 20-50x undercount Scottish: 27-55x Stanford: 50-85x Italian: 30x Mass: 17x Germany: 0.37% CFR Denmark: 0.21%  If true, COVID19 has much more spread and much lower fatality."

"This does not mean you are just as likely to die of the flu as you are of COVID19.   It means a young person is 7x more likely to be hospitalized by COVID19 as a mostly older person would from the flu, and as likely to die overall, as a mostly older person would be of the flu."

"People who deal with nonlinearities regularly (startup investors, gamblers, complexity researchers, epidemiologists) know that models are far too sensitive to assumptions to be taken literally.  All models do is help you decide when to flip from panic to greed and back to panic."
"A stimulus when the economy is shut down is more money chasing fewer goods and services. It‚Äòs necessary to cover the gap, but leads to inflation.  A stimulus after the shutdown can actually reignite true economic growth."
Politicians pretend every life has ‚ôæ value. But unending lockdowns will crush the economy.  One sharp lockdown. Then:  - Hide the old - Replace school w/ unmixed day care - Promote young & immune workers - No mass gatherings - Remote if possible - Back to work w/ masks & tests
It‚Äôs indicative. This virus spreads more easily than the flu.

WHO isn‚Äôt going to warn you.   CDC isn‚Äôt going to test you.  FDA isn‚Äôt going to cure you.  FEMA isn‚Äôt going to feed you.  Save yourself.
WHO said it‚Äôs not a pandemic and you shouldn‚Äôt wear masks.   CDC made its own tests and bungled them.   FDA blocked state tests for weeks and mask production for months.   Sporadic regional lockdowns and no internal borders mean this fire is going to burn until it‚Äôs out of fuel.

"Looking forward to the ImmuneCorps: A volunteer army of infection-recovered young people, to help the afflicted and keep the lights on."
Yes. Reread the original tweet.
There are five relevant studies linked in that tweet thread. Look again.
"There are at least five studies linked in the thread.   That‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúTweet,‚Äù it‚Äôs someone who doesn‚Äôt understand what a ‚ÄúThread‚Äù is."
"Studies show asymptomatic carriers spread the virus.  Everyone should wear masks (and distance, wash hands).  It‚Äôs a ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù argument, not just for individuals.  Prioritize medical staff. Surgical masks are paper and plastic, make more!  Billions of Asians aren‚Äôt wrong."
Thanks in advance to everyone adding other sites in the thread.
"Current market panic feels overblown. This is a short-term shock.   Asian countries show social distancing (assisted by seasonality in CVs) works.  Headlines will worsen as mass testing begins.  Take it seriously for yourself, wear masks for others.  Don‚Äôt panic trade (I don‚Äôt)."
"Panic will build until we all care enough.   Once we all care enough, we will beat the virus."
"Move the body, rest the mind."
"Knowledge is discovered collectively, wisdom is rediscovered individually."
[44:00] Vaccine is at least 12-18 months away...if we get one. Coronavirus vaccines didn‚Äôt get full effort in the past because they were either too mild and varied (colds) or too short-lived (SARS).  FIN.
"[38:30] mRNA vaccines like the Moderna vaccines can go into trials very quickly. Many, many vaccine candidates.  [40:00] Coronaviruses tend to be stable against mutation (for RNA viruses). There‚Äôs no selection pressure to mutate right now and this is spreading easily."
"[35:20] More likely undiagnosed cases than fatalities. 1%-2% fatality rate too high. Discrepancy between Wuhan and non-Wuhan cases. Health care interventions and ICU quality matter.  [37:00] Incubation average is 6 days, but up to 14 possible."
[27:50] This is not containable. Don‚Äôt quarantine or panic. Become personally resilient. Make the healthcare system resilient.  [33:00] Containment will inevitably fail and doesn‚Äôt buy much time.  [34:00] Wearing an N95 mask can‚Äôt be sustained for long. Wear only if sick.
[15:10] When a US Senator shames drug companies into stopping Zika vaccine development.  [25:20] We are in a mild-moderate pandemic (in life-years potentially lost).  [26:24] This will become endemic and return in the fall.
"[8:33] Coronaviruses are everywhere and peak in the winter / spring every year  [8:48] All of you have had a coronavirus in your life...just not this coronavirus. And you get reinfected with them, because antibodies fall over time."
Clever up-frame.
Creativity arises behind the conscious mind.
"Most of the time, it's mutually assured destruction."
Probably. But paying out regardless of who you voted for misdirects the bribe by one level.
Michael Bloomberg proved that it‚Äôs cheaper to buy a President than it is to buy the Presidency.
Nope.
Corollary: Hillary's biggest mistake was distancing her policies from Bill's.
Joe Biden's best bet in the general is just to promise a third term of doing whatever Obama says.
"Everybody wants to live a cleaner and more disease-free life. Technology can build us robust defenses, and we have time.  Novel coronavirus may give us the will."
Quarantine drills will be to the 2020s what nuclear drills were to the 1950s. Buildings and vehicles with advanced filtration systems will be the new fallout shelters.
"We can create a societal shift, from handshakes to head-shakes, from physical reality to virtual reality, from business travel to remote work."
"We can build dedicated treatment facilities with trained personnel, sealed rooms, and robotic assistants to isolate and treat patients without cross-infecting hospital residents and staff."
We can develop and stockpile antivirals and therapeutics to delay the spread of future pathogens long enough to develop and deploy vaccines.
"We can create an Apollo Program for accelerated vaccine development, to deliver vaccines in months or weeks, rather than years."
"We can build a network of sensors, eventually in our phones, to detect, identify and map new pathogens as they emerge, creating a realtime global warning grid."
A Space Corps looks to spread humanity across the stars. A Bio Corps would look to stop viruses from spreading across humanity.
Inspiration!
"It‚Äôll be interesting to track effects of heat and humidity on Coronavirus.   Presumably it‚Äôll lower the R0, but by how much? There has been spread in Singapore and Malaysia, but both seem contained and one has to disambiguate indoor AC-heavy environments from outdoor ones."
Too unimaginative and disempowering. Also weakens your critical faculties.
"Yes  ‚Ä¢ The initial thrill of wanting to do something tends to wear off. Same reason for having cooling off periods on purchases.  ‚Ä¢ Saying no usually preserves time, the scarcest resource, and optionality, which has higher value in a modern environment."
You are a story that you tell yourself.

My favorite western philosophers are physicists.

People will have to exit the system. That‚Äôs the only relief valve. And the authoritarians will try to close the exits.

"We have so many drugs now, electronic and chemical, that most of us are junkies most of the time."
A well-designed market for betting on climate change would allow the communities at greatest risk to buy insurance and literally transfer wealth from the ignorant to the knowledgeable.
"We are living in the golden age of art, and it‚Äôs only going to get better.   But we are desensitized by familiarity and overwhelmed by choice."
"The modern mental illness is anxiety.   The symptom is inability to fall asleep.  The evidence is pills, meditation apps, opioids, and sleep trackers.  The causes are oversocialization and overstimulation."

"Contributes for sure, but not leverage. You can‚Äôt keep applying more and more of it to increase your returns."
"No progress is possible without trial and error. Not in business, not in science, not in nature.   Without failure, there is no learning, no progress, and no success."
"Reread the tweet, especially the second sentence."
"There‚Äôs no investment where money works as hard as it does in a tech startup.   Driven founders, leveraged with code, capital, media, and intellect, sweating every dollar spent.  An enlightened society would educate investors, not restrict them."
Really depends on the specifics. Not as clear as it used to be. But still the default.
Direct experience always wins in the end.
Are you on solid rock right now?
"If you want the truth, take no one else‚Äôs word for it.  Accept only science, reason, and direct experience.  Start on solid ground. Mind each step."
Startups don‚Äôt need capital - they need signal.

Never tweet in anger.

"Think for yourself, not of yourself.   Think of others, not for others."
"The more people in the conversation, the harder it becomes to speak the uncomfortable truth.  Social media puts everyone into the same conversation."
"For the crowd to be wise, it has to be composed of independent actors voting with skin in the game - a market, which is very different than a herd."
"Both are true, choose what suits you."
"Major in Comp Sci, Physics or Math. Tackle the hardest subject possible and you can always learn the easier ones on your own time. If doing Econ, focus on micro and game theory. Macro is mostly politics with false precision."

Waiting for inspiration. It‚Äôll come.
"Usually that‚Äôs a cause for anger, slightly different emotion."
You‚Äôre offended when you fear that it might be true.
Working with a friend can cost both a business and a friendship.   It can work if the friendship came after working together.   It won‚Äôt work if the friendship came before and competence is merely assumed.
You won‚Äôt have inner peace until you give up your war against the world.

Every universal truth has an equally profound and opposite universal truth.
The gate to heaven is sealed with paradox.
"That‚Äôs good to know. And even if it doesn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt care. There is no path that can be followed."
Meditation is turning off society and listening to yourself.   It only ‚Äúworks‚Äù when done for its own sake.  Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Praying is gratitude meditation. Showering is accidental meditation.  Sitting quietly is direct meditation.
A happy person isn‚Äôt someone who‚Äôs happy all the time.   It‚Äôs someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don‚Äôt lose their innate peace.
"Every institution that distributes money, power, or status eventually becomes corrupted.   Democracy and free-market capitalism work by enforcing constant competition between political and economic institutions.   The faster the turnover, the lower the corruption."

I switched to lists.
"You wake up in the amusement park.  You ride the rides under supervision.   Then you indulge in thrilling rides.  Then you learn to operate the rides.   Then you grind out time giving rides to everyone else.   When the thought of rides makes you want to throw up, it‚Äôs time to go."

Don‚Äôt listen to society.
They want to punish you for your speech because they can‚Äôt punish you for your thoughts.
"The biggest cost of the attempt to thrive, is the worry. You even worry about the worrying."
I was quoting Benjamin Franklin. üôè
"Government has a local monopoly on violence and is always backed by force.   More laws & more wars lead to more enforcers, who dominate the state.   Democracies balance between electing weaklings, who let the military take charge, & strongmen, who just put the military in charge."
"The most powerful permissionless tools are the spoken word, the written word, mathematics, and the computer.  An irresistible stack of leverage for the ambitious creative."
"Engineers are leveraged creatives who generate repeatable solutions to practical problems.  Engineering automation increases leverage, productivity, and the scope of problems that engineers can tackle.  Until we become Gods, society has unlimited demand for creative engineers."
Everybody wants to hire the best.  Nobody wants to pay them the best.
True reasoning is only possible when there is no motivation.

No one yet has sold Bitcoin ‚Äúat the top.‚Äù
Amazon is a digital wallet that had to ship products to get installs.
Perhaps any algorithm that can influence large masses of voters should be open source.
"A politician who reads aloud speeches written by others is an actor, not a leader."
"The Internet shifts the balance of credibility from institutions to individuals.   Institutions are revealed as insatiable and corrupt, even as a billion potential leaders step onto the stage."
It‚Äôs not that paying down technical debt will make your startup successful. It‚Äôs that successful startups have the luxury of paying down technical debt.
"For knowledge work, time spent has little to do with value created and the forty hour workweek is anachronistic nonsense."
Wonder.
What the world craves is Authenticity.
Literacy is a lost art.
Proven community builders are even rarer and higher-leveraged than proven developers and designers. There‚Äôs no school or playbook.
"Now that industry is done with it, we can watch politicians go through a ‚ÄúBlockchain, not Bitcoin‚Äù phase."
Put a little ambiguity in your tweet to give the reader a subconscious puzzle to unlock.
The real schism in Bitcoin will happen when there‚Äôs a credible path towards making it fully private.
"The smarter you get, the slower you read."
Weaning is easier.
"In an age of abundance, the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake leads to addiction."
"Guerilla warfare with a large base of popular support is extremely effective. And in this case, the military is right-leaning anyway. Good luck."
I still don‚Äôt see how the unarmed half of the country is going to overthrow the candidate elected by the armed half of the country.
"Universities are upstream of political movements, so I have great faith in their ability to engineer a gargantuan bailout."
University degrees are the new taxi medallions.
Technology and trade consolidate production and democratize consumption.   The best in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.
Local environmentalism is to personal spirituality as global environmentalism is to organized religion.
"To maximize distribution, minimize the message.  ‚Ä¢ Books -> blog posts ‚Ä¢ Podcasts -> snippets ‚Ä¢ Blog posts -> tweetstorms ‚Ä¢ Use stand-alone tweets in tweetstorms ‚Ä¢ Tweet sparingly - high signal, low noise  Readers have options - respect their time."

Does it bother anyone else that our elected officials live in a panopticon run by our intelligence agencies?
Crypto may be an industry that is more valuable with a small set of users that don‚Äôt attract nation-state attention than a with a large set who do.
The actual political shift is that America is going from two political parties run by the elites to two political parties (temporarily) run by the masses.
"Any discipline or institution whose output is to tell people how to think and behave eventually gets co-opted and corrupted.   Only disciplines and institutions whose output tells us how to manipulate nature, tools, and systems can stay objective."
True religion is rejecting all teachings and thinking for yourself.
"Persistent, non-specific anxiety is the result of wanting so much, talking so much, and doing so much that you lose touch with the quiet joys of solitude."
Founder-mentality means not caring who gets the credit.
Creativity starts with an empty calendar and ends with a full one.

"Money does buy happiness, if you earned it."
"The two kinds of people - those who want money, and those who want status."
Do it. Although I think there are already several Spanish translations out there.
"The Apple Card is the last step before we get rid of credit cards altogether, and payments are just authenticated by your phone and face."
"Equity and bonuses doled out for long term thinking. Promote people with ‚Äúfounder mentality.‚Äù It‚Äôs not easy but probably the single most important thing. As Charlie Munger said:  ‚ÄúNever, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.‚Äù"
"Right, all couponing works this way."

Perhaps social media has a propensity to foment revolutions and civil wars.
Choose the non-emotional response to any given situation and see how much easier your life becomes.
It‚Äôs all white knights fighting each other.
"Unresolved thoughts, prematurely pushed out of the mind, pile up in an internal landfill - which eventually pokes out of the subconscious and manifests as chronic, nonspecific anxiety."
"The modern mind is overstimulated and the modern body is understimulated and overfed.   Meditation, exercise, and fasting restore an ancient balance."
"The Lindy Effect for startups:  The longer you go without shipping product, the more likely you will never ship product."
Block the outraged without a second thought. Don't join mobs. Defend those unfairly attacked.
"Social media lowers the cost of raising & joining mobs.  Per the Minority Rule, the most intolerant wins.  Mobs replace conversations with extremism. Journalists,  politicians, & society follow.  We can raise the cost up with software to expose and block the perpetually outraged."
"Have to do both. Investment is a skill, not necessarily a career."
"Investing well is a skill that everyone can and should learn.  Accreditation rules prevent learning and push people into a small set of ""safe"" assets, high-priced managers, and into lotteries / gambling.  Rules based on sophistication instead of net worth would lower inequality."

How to Gain Status (without doing work):
Twitter following is a meaningless metric. People listen to you in proportion to your insight and authenticity. Cultivate insight by following your genuine intellectual curiosity. Cultivate authenticity by giving up the need for social approval.
AI can do this.
Engineering. You can learn microeconomics in your spare time and by running a business.
Centralized stablecoins aren‚Äôt cryptocurrencies either. Just wait.
"Libra is a fine digital currency, but it‚Äôs not a cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrencies have value precisely due to decentralization.  Muddling the two may be in Libra‚Äôs interests in the short term, but is against everyone‚Äôs interests in the long term."

"Felt arbitrary and two dimensional. It doesn‚Äôt make risky predictions, nor is it falsifiable. Not sure what the point of such a toy model is."
The one thing everyone here has in common is Twitter.   And Twitter can‚Äôt fight back against its own users.   Which makes it the best punching bag on Twitter.
I have an:
Not sure. Perhaps publish / subscribe of block-lists and mute-lists would help.
"Yes, humans adapt to the new point and it becomes no more special than the original one.  Slippery slope fallacy is only a fallacy using the unrealistic examples that the people calling it a fallacy use.  Given that it‚Äôs case by case, there‚Äôs no point in calling it a fallacy."
"Thanks, but taking a break right now."
"Retirement starts when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow.  You retire by saving up enough money, becoming a monk, or by finding work that feels like play to you."
The economic returns to living in a city that‚Äôs living in the future are increasing.

"The most valuable startup of the last decade didn‚Äôt raise money, didn‚Äôt have employees, gave away the cap table, and let anyone invest."
"I don‚Äôt know if this generation is the last mortal generation, or the last one before we blow ourselves up."
Doesn‚Äôt impress my wife either.

"When it comes to technology development, one free genius is worth more than a million marching scientists."
On the road to obsolescence.
It‚Äôs increasingly clear that the wealth and power of any given nation state will be proportional to its ability to create and utilize new technology.
"Modern society will shame you for earning money, shame you for being happy, shame you for being raised well, shame you for having children, and ultimately, shame you for existing.  It isn‚Äôt just religion that controls you by declaring you a sinner."

"Didn‚Äôt resonate. IMO mathematical statements are analytic, not synthetic. I.e., in 2+2=4 neither 2 contains the number 4 but the ‚Äò+‚Äô operator contains an algorithm which carries a lot of information and means that ‚Äò2+2‚Äô does contain 4. So there is no synthetic a priori knowledge."

"The best relationships are peer relationships.  When given power over others, our ego justifies it by assuming we are smarter.  Better to have people work with us than for us.  Better motivated on the wrong thing than unmotivated on the right thing.   Debate rather than dictate."
At what point do social media companies stop propping up legacy media online? Stop giving them privileged placement and status? Level the playing field for independent journalists and the people?
Anything in your pockets that‚Äôs not a smartphone will be replaced by the smartphone.
"Online payments will follow password storage and contacts to become a core mobile OS feature, rather than remain with third parties.   Sensors, biometrics, and browser integration all reduce fraud, increase convenience, and enable new features.   Software eats consumer banking."
Apple Pay could erode Amazon‚Äôs checkout advantage the same way the mobile address book eroded Facebook‚Äôs social graph advantage.

Your real resum√© is a painful recounting of all of your struggles.
"Crypto is spawning a generation of programmers that understand the fundamentals of game theory, finance, and governance."

"Unfortunately, the popularity of mobile means the bootstrap strategy ( 4) likely won‚Äôt work."
"You have to surrender, at least a little bit, to be the best version of yourself possible."
"Digital privacy is more important than ever, because as it goes, so does the freedom to speak."
"On the distant horizon are trustless, decentralized, and easy-to-use blockchain-based social apps. They can't break existing network effects, but they can wait for a platform to stumble."
Oblivious platforms will remain heavy handed and eventually be regulated and nationalized once they are properly classified as information monopolies.
The smart social media platforms will hand the tools to the people or hide them behind inscrutable algorithms. Publish / subscribe of spam and block lists can clean up discussions in a decentralized way.
"Once a social media platform demonstrates its true power, its days as a free entity are numbered. If a platform has the power to appoint rulers, then the platform's rulers must be appointed."
The people designing the algorithms to shape online debate are now the most powerful people in the world.
The social media platforms themselves live in fear and have begun to wield the heavy hand of censorship to placate the digital mob.
The best accounts on social media are anonymous. The worst accounts on social media are anonymous.
"The best defense against a digital mob is to avoid being targeted. Most people will keep their heads down, a brave few will speak out, but honesty now hides behind anonymity."
"Loyal members of digital mobs are so oblivious that they don't even see the problem, as long as they're on the winning side."
"Armchair generals can make a living and gain social status inciting digital mobs, sometimes even as members of the media."
"Today there is no cost to joining a digital mob. Over time, there will be tools that identify and expose the easily and perpetually outraged."
"Every successful digital mob strike narrows the Overton Window, softly suffocating speech online."

Perhaps Keto is just real Paleo with a tight feedback loop.
"Money isn‚Äôt an invention. It isn‚Äôt even a discovery. It‚Äôs intrinsic to the human species.   It‚Äôs how we keep track of debts with strangers, and cooperate across genetic boundaries - something no other species can do."
Ways to get lucky:  ‚Ä¢ Hope luck finds you.  ‚Ä¢ Hustle until you stumble into it.  ‚Ä¢ Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.  ‚Ä¢ Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.

The killer app for crypto is Socialism.
"People weren't scared of software until fundraising entrepreneurs rebranded everything as ""A.I.""  Anthropomorphizing automation creates a definitive ""it"" to resist."
"Founders run every sprint as if they‚Äôre about to lose, but grind out the long race knowing that victory is inevitable."
"Building technology means you don‚Äôt have to choose between practicing science, commerce, and art."
They won‚Äôt be democracies.
Evolution is forcing you.
"The modern struggle  Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower,  fasting, meditating, and exercising,  up against armies of scientists & statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, & medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games & addictive drugs."
Not as something independent of the American Empire. Artificial biospheres are trivially easy to destroy. Like popping a balloon.  Unless Mars aims a lot of nukes at Earth first.
"The distant future is small free cities with drone armies and skill-based immigration policies, surrounded by a sea of failed socialist states."
"As the elites get kicked out of each party, we are going from Republicans vs Democrats to Nationalists vs Socialists."
"Whether in commerce, science, or politics, history remembers the artists."
"Since people are getting confused - this isn't about drones carrying humans, it's about drones as Surface to Air Missiles."
New technologies enable new behaviors which would have led to eradication from the gene pool earlier.

"Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.  Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.   Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit."
These are more likely to be 20-minute explorations / musings than full-on podcasts. Don't take them too seriously.

"Changing habits:  Pick one thing. Cultivate a desire. Visualize it.  Plan a sustainable path.  Identify needs, triggers, and substitutes.  Tell your friends.  Track meticulously.  Self-discipline is a bridge to a new self-image.  Bake in the new self-image. It‚Äôs who you are, now."
"The overeducated are worse off than the undereducated, having traded common sense for the illusion of knowledge."
"In physical domains (diet, workouts), consistency is king.  In intellectual and social domains, wins are rare, sudden, and nonlinear - 99% of effort is ‚Äúwasted.‚Äù   Once we find our ideal spouse, career, friends, we realize how much time we squandered by not moving on sooner."
"I wouldn‚Äôt overthink aphorisms, this isn‚Äôt math where every statement has to check out in every context. Consistency is good for long term relationships, but it also traps us into not changing when we need to. There is no right or wrong way to behave here, just understand."

"Two kinds of happiness.  Worldly happiness is reward from our evolutionary program. Get praise, money, drugs, sex. It busies the mind with craving & anxiety.  Internal happiness is reward from being in flow. Create, meditate, love, play. It clears the mind & leaves us in peace."
Intellectual and social domains tend towards nonlinear outcomes. It's more important to find nonlinear upside than it is to try and improve an existing linear situation.
The compound interest from many quick small iterations is greater than the compound interest from a few slow big iterations. Compound interest operates in most intellectual and social domains.
"Learn from times iterated over time spent.  Craft a thousand tweets before ten blog posts before one novel.  Skim a dozen books before absorbing one.  Make many small investments before a few big bets.  Build many small products before starting a company.  Explore, then exploit."

I'm not sure how much more I've left to say that isn't just redundant. I tried a Twitter AMA recently as well.  Most podcasts have guests. Most serial shows are about current events. I don't do either...
"Knowledge is discovered by all of us, each adding to the whole.  Wisdom is rediscovered by each of us, one at a time."

Not at all.
"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous."
"If I were, I would go back."
"People with ‚Äúfounder mentality‚Äù can‚Äôt rest once a problem or opportunity is identified.   They take on personal responsibility without complaint, learn and recruit skills as needed, and deliver results despite politics.  There is unlimited global demand for founder mentality."
"I believe that quote is actually Vinod Khosla's, not mine."
Signaling virtue is a vice.
A future society may support overclocking brilliant young scientists with mental performance enhancing drugs to get more scientific breakthroughs.
Investing favors the dispassionate. Markets efficiently separate emotional investors from their money.
Scaling a company via code and contracts instead of via people mitigates the Principal-Agent problem.   Scaling via community-generated code and content mitigates Hayek‚Äôs Local Knowledge problem.
"Instead of calling them scooter licenses, let‚Äôs just call them what they are, scooter medallions."
"Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world.  Judge, and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you have it.  Heaven and hell are right here, right now."
"One cypherpunk attribute of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency that has been lost to ASIC mining (and doesn‚Äôt even exist with Proof of Stake) is the ability to obtain the currency, on demand, in a highly censorship resistant manner."
"Knowledge is a skyscraper. You can take a shortcut with a fragile foundation of memorization, or build slowly upon a steel frame of understanding."
One way you know that crypto is its own asset class and not a subset of tech - eventually every crypto-focused Partner in a venture fund spins out and sets up shop on their own.

"Investors have different incentives than founders.   What investors often look for in a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù founder is irrational behavior that the investor doesn‚Äôt engage in themselves.   I.e., 80-hour weeks for 10 years, passing up a big acquisition to go for broke, zero diversification."
Teaching is more a way for the teacher to learn than for the student to learn.
"Politics and merit are opposite ends of a spectrum.  More political organizations are less productive, have less inequality, and top performers opt out.   More merit based organizations have higher productivity, more inequality, and higher odds of internal fracture."
"Alone is a fact, lonely is a choice. We are so afraid to be alone that we end up lonely. The ability to be alone without being lonely is a superpower."
"Probably. Whichever STEM discipline I enjoyed the most. For me, a combination of physics and computer science."

"Twitter is online society. To survive it, the individual must ignore the news, leave the mobs, disassociate from the angry and the confused, and dismiss both compliments and insults."
"Twitter is a microphone. It makes instant celebrities of each of us, with retweet fame and follower fans. Celebrities may be the unhappiest people in the world."
Twitter is a network. It connects people based on their ideas rather than on their pre-existing relationships.
"Twitter is a school. The most spiritual, scientific, and literary minds on the planet freely share their distilled works. And every fool shouts over them."
"Twitter is a mob. A mob of angry and confused people, who destroy targets with no individual feeling responsibility for the killing blow."

Sound money by definition accrues value. A successful computing platform creates value but where the value accrues is variable.
There‚Äôs religion and there‚Äôs Religion. It always starts as religion but gets the bad rap when it becomes Religion.
It‚Äôs possible that both censorship-resistant sound money and permissionlessly-programmable computing platforms are going to be huge.

"When building habits, choose consistency over content.  The best book is the one you can‚Äôt put down.  The best exercise is the one you enjoy doing every day.  The best health food is the one you find tasty.  The best work is the work you‚Äôd do for free."
It‚Äôs easier to become successful by being good at a few different things than by being great at one thing.
Contracts will be encrypted and Zero-Knowledge Proofs will provide selective disclosure to each party.
"A firm is just a ""nexus of contracts."" Payroll contracts with employees, profit contracts with shareholders, debt contracts with lenders, delivery contracts with customers, tax contracts with the state.  Blockchain-based ""smart"" contracts will eventually reinvent the firm."
That‚Äôs the spiritual equivalent of people who say they don‚Äôt work out because they don‚Äôt want too much muscle.
"Most people are a mess inside and creating more of a mess outside. First, fix yourself. Then you can tell others what to do (although then you may not want to)."

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.
"If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts."
An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
"Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you."
"Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don‚Äôt waste your life chasing it."
"Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment."
"Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media)."
"‚ÄúGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.‚Äù  - Archimedes"
"The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon."
"Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage."
Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
"When specific knowledge is taught, it‚Äôs through apprenticeships, not schools."
Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
"Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you."
"Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage."
"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."
Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
"Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity."
"Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest."
The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
You‚Äôre not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
"Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you."
"Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy."

"The older the problem, the older the solution. How to eat well is one of the oldest problems."
"School, politics, sports, and games train us to compete against others. True rewards - wealth, knowledge, love, fitness, and equanimity - come from ignoring others and improving ourselves."
This was too clever by half and came out vague. I must be tweeting so many vapid aphorisms that people are giving me a pass...
"If you create intersections, you‚Äôre going to have collisions."
"I no longer fully believe this. Being ethical is more profitable long term, assuming an iterated game. Although power law outcomes reward the unethical as they can win big in one move."
Luckily I have the Twitter time stamp. üòâ

Proof-of-Work electricity is the cost of decentralized currency. Inflation is the cost of centralized currency. Which is cheaper?

Twitter makes me more:
Kids only pick fights with kids of their age and size. We only make enemies that we‚Äôre capable of taking on. Goes to show how fictional and chosen our ‚Äúenemies‚Äù are.
"Glad you liked it, it's a gem."

All the con men I‚Äôve ever known con themselves first and foremost.
Persistence is paramount on the long road to product-market fit.  Partners disappoint. Customers delay. Growth stalls. Passions fade.  Loyalty to each other gets the team to the other side.
Fair point. It‚Äôs case by case depending on the magnitude of the innovation.

"It‚Äôs valid as direct, personal experience. But not transmissible to others unless you can recreate it for them."
"Wide network, high standards and ironclad integrity."
Currently indistinguishable from false but worth working on to verify or falsify as transmissible truth.
Build a reputation that makes other people do deals through you.
Personal framework for filtering truth.
"Knowledge is either from direct experience or from verifiable, falsifiable science.   There is knowledge that is transmitted but not verifiable / falsifiable, and this knowledge is indistinguishable from that which is false."
"Yes, but out of interest, not ambition."
Numeracy is the modern literacy.
Start making small investments early in life:  ‚Ä¢ Takes many failures to figure it out  ‚Ä¢ Best investments have long feedback loops  ‚Ä¢ Capital : labor ratio generally increases in life  ‚Ä¢ Can improve all the way through old age

"A lion is prized for its strength and a bird for its flight, their uniquely expressed attributes.   Similarly, humans are prized for their reason, and not their trappings - physical, material or social."
"The biggest cost of politics is that it can cause you to have comforting, false, and ultimately expensive beliefs about business and science."
Smart partners negotiate fair deals because they know that lopsided deals are fragile and that most value accumulates in long term trust relationships.  You can tell a lot about a potential partner by their opening offer.
Maybe you should just unfollow. I have no intention of living up to anyone‚Äôs expectations.
"Groups can‚Äôt admit to their members that they were wrong. That‚Äôs why when they lose in public, they fall back to conspiracy theories."
"When the email hosts, the web hosts, the domain registrars, the banks, the payment systems, the censors and the politicians crack down on crypto... only then will we see the true power of decentralization."
The selfish reason to be ethical is that it attracts the other ethical people in the network.

Escape competition through authenticity.
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a human being who remained independent, resisted conditioning, never belonged to any religion, political party, organization, nation, race. I‚Äôve been myself, without any adjective. That has given me integrity, individuality, authenticity, and the bliss of fulfillment.‚Äù -Osho"

Check the date on the tweet...
Building a brand? Curate your output so your followers don‚Äôt have to.
Young Bill Gates would be building a blockchain company right now.
"The Efficient Markets Hypothesis fails because humans are herd animals, not independent rational actors. Thus the best investors tend to be antisocial and contrarian."
Social media increases the returns to intolerance.
"Some do, some don‚Äôt."
"You can turn off retweets for someone you follow but when they merely ‚Äúlike‚Äù something, it shows up in your feed. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought - they must be earned."
Bezos owning the Washington Post is the cheapest subtle political insurance that Amazon can buy. $250 Million insures $700 Billion against anti-trust action.
"Sorry, they‚Äôre unscheduled and spontaneous."
"So for a Curation Business, start with a brand and keep your standards high."
Nor can you select too many candidates (unless you‚Äôre good at burying your failures). It‚Äôll cheapen your curation signal.
What doesn‚Äôt work well is to just enter the business and assume that you‚Äôll build a brand over time. You may never get enough high quality applicants.
"The hardest part is the initial branding. You can do it by bringing an existing brand from the outside, addressing a new vertical, an audacious new approach, or by creating unique content."
"if you‚Äôre building one of these businesses, use marketing, judgement, and execution to optimize this brand-based virtuous circle."
"The curator repeats the cycle, now with a stronger umbrella brand."
The winning alumni brands reinforce the curator‚Äôs umbrella brand.
The emerging winners become proud alumni
The curated use the curator‚Äôs umbrella brand to gain validation with the rest of the world.
They educate and help the curated in alignment with their brand.
They run a tight filter to select the best of the best.
They build an umbrella brand to attract as many applicants as possible.
"Universities, Incubators, and Venture Capital firms are really ‚ÄúCuration Businesses.‚Äù"
"To be clear folks, this is a game, at best. These cards aren‚Äôt worth anything. Not sure why people are bidding them up."
4% of each sale which I‚Äôll either donate to charity or not collect. Get a grip.
The future revolution will be digital.
"But physical space is gone. They‚Äôve carved it all up, from Antarctica to the moon."
The freer societies of the last few hundred years were founded through escape. Found a new colony or kingdom.
The long arc of politics bends towards centralization. And no internal revolution is possible when the system is (accidentally) designed for two parties only.
"That trade off mainly makes sense at a local level. If most spending was local, it would be a different equation.   But power continues to coalesce in central authorities."
But who has the time? Everyone is busy. You‚Äôre either bought into a party brand or apathy. Or you‚Äôre spending enormous personal time for tiny social gains.
The presidency used to be part of the two party system. But media splintered and political ads don‚Äôt work like they used to. Social media + crowdfunding means that the Presidency is the first office where independents and outsiders have a shot.
"Voters can pledge their vote to a third party candidate, keep track of pledges, and only cast their vote when the candidate has the desired threshold. If not, vote for your normal big party candidates.  (This system is however vulnerable to sybil attacks and fake pledges)."
The Internet provides the means to coordinate a vote for a third party.
"When the country swings too far to the right, you get Obama. Too far to the left, you get Trump. Too far to the Trump and...?"
"Both parties take extreme positions, speaking a different language. When the normally apathetic middle bothers to vote, it wins."
Democracy survives at the margin - the most powerful voter is the rational Independent whose vote isn‚Äôt promised to anyone.
Looking for someone to blame for consolidation of power? There's no one to blame. That's just how power works.
Looking for someone to blame for polarization? There‚Äôs no one to blame. The system is the problem.
"And neither one wants to talk about endless wars, mass surveillance, university costs, infinite debt, over-classification, and corruption."
"On health care, one party is talking about minimal human decency while the other party is doesn't want health care run by the DMV."
"On guns, one party is talking about mass-murder while the opposite party is now talking about self-sovereignty."
"On abortion, one party is talking about the definition of life while the other party is talking about self-sovereignty."
"On immigration, one party is talking about legal immigrants while the other party is talking about illegal immigrants."
"When you're on completely opposite sides of an issue, it's even easier to just talk about two different issues and call them the same thing."
"The two parties then are under selective pressure to evolve as far apart. If they drift towards the other party, then they risk creating apathy when they want passion.   Therefore, there‚Äôs no ""middle ground party"" in politics."
"The parties have to brand strongly as strongly as possible, to create the faithful core and to hook the apathetic. To make them play the game."
"Scale effects rule the world around me. Including when it comes to branding, spreading messages, rallying resources."
"The parties want to get as many voters as possible. The majority of voters are apathetic, not even playing the political game."
"It is the nature of a winner-take-all system to consolidate down to two entities.  Any third-place party can always combine with the second-place party to become the new first-place party.  Therefore, our system can only represent two choices on any given topic."
"A Political party is a coalition to monopolize the vote.  The framers of the constitution neglected to ban political parties, as it would infringe upon freedom of speech. So political parties monopolized the vote."
"Thanks, but that sounds like a job. I like the spontaneity of periscope."
The Apple HomePod crushes it on sound quality. Siri remains awful but it sounds like a much more expensive and larger speaker.
The right to debate should not be up for debate.
The Praetorian class is its own beast.
"Since people are asking: ‚Ä¢ Money elites are just the wealthy ‚Ä¢ Status elites are politicians, journalists, academics, priests  When they fight, one uses the masses to destroy the other (revolution)."
Left vs. Right is too simplistic. That‚Äôs the fight for the scraps. The real fault lines are: ‚Ä¢ Elites v Masses ‚Ä¢ Money Elites v Status Elites
"It is. Every collective activity has some ratio of individualism to tribalism, overlaid with emotion. Politics is on an extreme end of the scale."
Me.
Literally everyone who got triggered by this tweet - go look at their timelines. Full of political ranting.
Engaging in politics habituates and rewires the brain to value agreement and signaling. It weakens the ability to reason independently and clearly.
Are there examples of small groups of academic outcasts creating new fields in science? The cypherpunks come to mind. Are there others?
Applies to relationships too.
"If you‚Äôre more passionate about founding a business than the business itself, you can fall into a ten year trap. Better to stay emotionally unattached and select the best opportunity that arises."
Markets adapt much faster these days. Crypto went from the ‚ÄúNetscape Moment‚Äù to the ‚ÄúDotcom Bubble‚Äù to the ‚ÄúCrash of 2000‚Äù in months.
The Twitter / Instagram follow graphs are stronger moats. Friend graphs grow faster (they‚Äôre viral) but are easier to replicate and lower quality.
"The interesting next battleground is, of course, money."
"Re: Facebook. FB was trying to monopolize the social graph. The permissionlessly programmable version of that is the mobile contact list. Thanks to that, an unending series of mobile apps assaults FB. FB stays afloat via smart acquisitions but its social graph monopoly is dead."
People once thought that AOL would beat the open web. Permissionless programmability and uncensorability seemed unimportant.  Don‚Äôt bet against a distributed army of self-interested programmers.
"The top two skillsets for blockchain entrepreneurs, in order:   Technology development. Community development.   That‚Äôs it."
This actually applies to any form of public performance.
The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone.
"I did a periscope and will likely do more. Much easier than a podcast, direct connection to the audience."
Unethical and fake - they should take me down from their website. I am neither attending nor speaking there.
"Of course, given the way identity and confirmation bias work, everyone who has done vipassana will feel compelled to fire back."
"Sophisticated foods are bittersweet (wine, beer, coffee, chocolate).   Addictive relationships are cooperative and competitive.  Work becomes flow at the limits of ability.  The flavor of life is on the edge."
"Meh, I know it‚Äôs popular to hate humans but self-hate is a lousy way to live life."
"Technology starts with fire, the lever, the wheel. It‚Äôs not just iPhones and Teslas."
Simple mistake. Chill out.
I‚Äôd just posted it in the wrong place...as a reply to me instead of to you.
"Technology is not only the thing that moves the human race forward, but it‚Äôs the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we‚Äôre just monkeys playing in the dirt."
"The cryptocurrency that wins the most valuable near-term use case, ‚ÄúStore of Value,‚Äù is going to be the one that‚Äôs most decentralized (given privacy)."
"Decentralization is not an attribute of ‚Äúfaircoins‚Äù necessarily, but I will grant you that..."
‚ÄúFaircoins‚Äù are coins with very wide airdrops - billions of people.
"The more widely distributed cryptocurrencies are, the greater the chance they survive a showdown with governments. Look to the upcoming wave of ‚Äúfaircoins.‚Äù"
Success is the enemy of learning. It can deprive you of the time and the incentive to start over. Beginner‚Äôs mind also needs beginner‚Äôs time.
"Fair. But it‚Äôs such an eye-popping number that I may take the tweet down until we can corroborate it. The larger point about SK being all-in stands, of course. Thanks again."
Seems high and his incentive is to exaggerate...
Thanks for the feet on the ground reporting. Do you have a source for the 30% estimate?
Doesn‚Äôt mean everyone should run out and buy cryptocurrency at these prices... Too many of the top 20 are still scams or shams.
"I keep updating this list so rather than blindly following everyone on it, please subscribe to the list or refer to it from time to time. It‚Äôs dynamic, not static."
Don‚Äôt debate people in the media when you can debate them in the marketplace.
First round of coin airdrops went to devs and miners. Second round to investors and BTC / ETH holders. Third round will try to reach every human on the planet.

"Bitcoin is a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme."
"Eventually, every game theory textbook will have a chapter on public blockchains."
Liked it but didn‚Äôt finish it.
Yes and yes.
Not tonight. May be a while. I don‚Äôt plan them...entirely spontaneous. But periscope has replays.
"If what you‚Äôre really asking is ‚Äúcan I do this too,‚Äù I think the answer is yes."

The crypto startups are showing that the last barrier to distributed startups is the geographic concentration of venture capital.
"A contrarian isn‚Äôt one who always objects - that‚Äôs a confirmist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up, and resists pressure to conform."
"The real struggle isn‚Äôt proletariat vs bourgeois. It‚Äôs between high-status elites and wealthy elites. When their cooperation breaks, revolution."
Ubiquitous streaming cameras with remote storage will eventually end almost all physical criminal activities.
"A wise man once told me:  ‚ÄúSomeone, somewhere, has to be happy all the time... might as well be me!‚Äù"
Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is that they have no extrinsic value. Purely single player games.
One explanation for the Fermi Paradox is that any sufficiently evolved species eventually perfects wireheading.
"Agreed, they'll compete first for new markets where the scarce resources are provisioned, tracked, and verified on-chain."
Software is gnawing on Venture Capital.
"Yes, ICOs are creating a bubble lemon market right now.  But long term, ICOs unbundle advice, control, and money, and remove the liquidity premium that VCs used to capture."
Seed is the new Series A.   ICO is the new Series B.
"Branding requires accountability. To build a great personal brand (an eponymous one), you must take on the risk of being publicly wrong."
This is a fragment of it.
"Before you can lie to another, you must first lie to yourself."
Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.
Money embodies the trust and enables trustlessness. ‚ÄúIn God we Trust‚Äù etc.
"If we are lucky, there will be a flight to quality. If not, then a massive pump followed by a dump."
"This bubble may still have legs. The real flood of ICOs, Innovation, and Institutions is coming."
Yes. Read the context starting from the top. In this case it means ‚Äúnot selling all of your shares.‚Äù
"Some of it is valid but it quickly runs into politics. Microeconomics, game theory and common sense are better guides."
Sure.
People who try to look smart by pointing out obvious exceptions actually signal the opposite.
Twitter is a way to broadcast messages to hundreds of millions of people to find the few dozen that you actually want to talk to.
Making money through an early lucky trade is the worst way to win. The bad habits that it reinforces will lead to a lifetime of losses.
You‚Äôre never going to get rich renting out your time.
"Lots of literacy in modern society, but not enough numeracy."
A lot of my retweets are of tweet from people that I don‚Äôt follow...and a lot of people I do listen to are in private lists. So I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a great strategy üò¨.
"If we‚Äôre talking fully-issued market cap (and we should), then $XRP is tied with $BTC at $300B."
"Avoid trivial forks, anything with a promotional budget, any developers not open to criticism and feedback. Developers without deep backgrounds in distributed systems or brand new to the space."
"However, as a general rule I would stick to coins that are highly decentralized, having shipping code, high quality scientists, are doing something technically novel / unique. I can count them on one hand."
I don‚Äôt give investment advice on Twitter. And this space has a way of summoning highly-incented lynch mobs.
"It‚Äôs disheartening to see how many of the top cryptocurrencies are hand-waving, technically inept, or outright scams."
*Ethereum
Low probability of an asymmetric payoff v. high probability of a consistent payoff.
Reading my old blog posts makes me cringe. The posturing is so obvious. ü§î
"I‚Äôm not here to judge him or decide what intentions are positive or negative. I might have done the same in his position.  I‚Äôm simply pointing out that it‚Äôs a negative signal to the rest of the holders, not a positive one as they fervently wish it was."
Of course it‚Äôs unlikely that Charlie timed the top. But he likely created a local maxima via unintentional signaling.
"Actually, my perspective isn‚Äôt contrarian. That‚Äôs the funny thing - ask literally any VC. Only in crypto-land is up down and down up."
The two are orthogonal. Investors usually expect both financial commitment and time commitment. And the former is often the more honest signal.
It‚Äôs common sense. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you. Good luck.
"Nah, it's a total guess."
"Involve groups in the creative process and you inevitably end up with a pile of pleasing, socially-acceptable lies. Contrast blockbuster movies with the great books."

Technology is the application of knowledge to control the natural world. It's the greatest driver of both human prosperity and our capacity for self-annihilation.

"Meditation, arts and artisanship, craftsmanship, politics, are other activities with learning curves detatched from physical ability."
Investing is one of the few professions where you can objectively improve every day until the day that you die.
It‚Äôs right down there with the probability of us all spontaneously combusting. It‚Äôs nonsense to talk about infinitesimal probabilities.
Nope. Probabilistically impossible.
Apples and oranges. The blockchain breakthrough is to create actual digital scarcity. I can copy your phone number but that doesn‚Äôt mean your phone calls route to me.
"Society has had multiple stores of value, as none is perfectly secure. Gold, oil, dollars, real estate, (some) bonds & equities. Crypto is the first that‚Äôs decentralized *and* digital."
"Crypto is a bet against the modern macroeconomic dogma, which is passed off as science, but is really a branch of politics - with rulers, winners, and losers."
Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority.
Nukes shifted the balance of power utterly to large and advanced nation states over small states.  Drones do the same but for nation states over individuals.
"I don‚Äôt trade or hold. Both are technically hard, easier to outsource to funds."
The endpoint of drone technology is guided bullets.
"The biggest gains in investing come when you bet against a gloomy crowd, on the upside. The low price already bakes their opinion in. Your losses are limited to 1x, and your gains are uncapped."
Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy.   Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.
"Crypto is the greatest videogame ever created. Play 24/7 with everyone in the world, directly from your phone. New challengers, meme wars, and MONEY. Every new player has to pay off all of the existing ones."
True. But the increase in the rate of debt is actually down (2nd derivative) and growth is rising as control moves from government to private sector.
Joe Public beat Wall Street to crypto.
"Then by all means, short the market."
(Not here to argue or give investment advice. Just showing my cards).
Lots of people confuse their political outlook with their economic outlook. The next few years look all set for an economic boom.
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the outrage?‚Äù seems like such a quaint little phrase now.

"It‚Äôs trying to attack the problem of what happens when we can make people euphoric, blissed out, or content by shooting electrical impulses into their brain."
"If you‚Äôre desensitized to the fact that you‚Äôre going to die, consider it a different way. As far as you‚Äôre concerned, this world is going to end. Now what?"
No. I‚Äôd bet on the Internet.
"Tulips are not durable, not scarce, not programmable, not fungible, not verifiable, not divisible, and hard to transfer. But tell me more about your analogy..."
"To bootstrap a new money, create a religion around it. The core teaching is to hodl at all costs, no matter the temptation, until all unbelievers capitulate."
Nonsensical extrapolation gives nonsensical results.

"A small band of deeply committed believers will spread a story better than a horde of the lightly committed. True for religion, reputation, brand, currency, politics..."
"Objectively, the world is improving. To the elites, it‚Äôs falling apart as their long-lived institutions are flattened by the Internet."

One of the most damaging and widespread social beliefs is the idea that most adults are incapable of learning new skills.
One tweet at a time üòâ.
"Survival & Replication put us on the work treadmill. Hedonic adaptation keeps us there. The trick is knowing when to jump off, and play instead."
Social media turns ideas into a popularity contest. Real creativity dissents from the status quo. Social media may slow the progress of the species.
"The problem with getting good at a game, especially one with big rewards, is that you continue playing it long after you should have outgrown it."
The people pushing tech companies to exercise censorship are the same people who will push to have the companies regulated for their power later.

"Internet gave us programmable, digital abundance. Blockchains give us programmable, digital scarcity, mapping better to the real world."
"The technical advantages of cryptocurrencies are bootstrap mechanisms for mass-belief. Once enough people believe in a currency, it's real."
"The advanced concepts in a field are novel, less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we'd be better off nailing the basics."
There won‚Äôt be a post-capitalist society. Language and free exchange co-evolved and are fundamental to how our species cooperates.
"Imagine if Disney owned the English protocol - licensing vocabulary, minting words, and bounding speech. Now consider the money protocol."

"Think back to what you were doing 5, 10, 15+ years ago. Really visualize it. What advice would you give your younger self? Is it consistent?"
The first countries to go to war with cryptocurrencies are those with capital controls. The two are inherently incompatible.

"20/ Truth is a lonely, and unprofitable, business."
"19/ Stop sorting people, including yourself, into groups."
17/ Lies need to be repeated to sustain. The truth just is.
16/ From private truths to public lies. From knowledge to outrage. From positive sum to zero sum.
15/ We are moving from a world where it pays to spread facts to one where it pays to spread opinions. From real goods to signaling goods.
"14/ Economic logic will drive an information business towards signaling goods. They‚Äôre easy to manufacture & share, and pay social rewards."
13/ Campus social action is a signaling good. That‚Äôs why universities are more focused on agreeing what to think than teaching how to think.
12/ Editorial outrage is a signaling good. That‚Äôs why former news outlets have switched from facts to opinions and outrage.
11/ Social media has degenerated into a deafening cacophony of groups signaling and repeating their shared myths.
"10/ Religious myths, secret histories, conspiracy theories, unfalsifiable beliefs, scapegoats..."
9/ Every group has a set of shared myths that signal to believers and against outsiders.
"7/ The further, the faster, and the more easily something can be shared, the better it is for signaling. Social media fuels signaling."
"6/ Signaling goods can be physical - handbags, watches, and fancy cars. They can be virtual - political, religious, and tribal affiliations."
"4/ While the business model for distributing facts and truth dies out, the model for distributing opinions and signaling goods is booming."
3/ Newspapers have been exposed as mostly reprinting Reuters and AP. They can‚Äôt make a living selling access to facts anymore.
2/ The facts are still there and people can still reach them. But the institutions selling access to facts have lost their business models.

12/ ...and wash away our obsolete industrial-education system.

9/ The tools for learning are abundant. It‚Äôs the desire to learn that‚Äôs scarce.
8/ The best teachers are on the Internet. The best books are on the Internet. The best peers are on the Internet.
"7/ Even today, what to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long."

Hard to stop people from buying cryptocurrencies. Ban purchases and computers will mine them out of thin air. Money = code = speech.
Operating an economy without cryptocurrencies will eventually be like operating one without financial markets today.

"4/ Blockchains are distributed ledgers which track tokens. The tokens can represent securities, currencies, assets, rights... case by case."
"3/ Doesn‚Äôt address tokens w/ launched blockchains & live networks. If those aren‚Äôt securities, good news for some ICOs and exchange trading."
2/ Selling contracts for tokens or selling income streams are clearly securities and will be treated as such.

"FIN/ Thank you, Satoshi Nakomoto. And to all the shoulders that Satoshi stands upon."
"36/ Ultimately, the nation-state is just a network (of networks)."
"35/ Blockchain-based market networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things."
"34/ Networks governed without kings, priests, elites, corporations and mobs. Networks governed by anyone with merit to the network."
33/ Blockchains give us new ways to govern networks. For banking. For voting. For search. For social media. For phone and energy grids.
"32/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob."
31/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain without a coin just like it's nonsensical to have a market without money.
"30/ Blockchains' open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs."
29/ Blockchains port the market model into places where it couldn't go before.
"28/ To a blockchain, merit can mean security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content..."
27/ Blockchains combine the openness of democracy and the Internet with the merit of markets.
26/ Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Etherium pays for (executing and verifying) computation.

"21/They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems."
20/ Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money.
19/ Until now.
18/ Market networks work where there is a commitment of money. Otherwise they are just mob networks. The applications are limited.
17/ The market networks are titans. The credit markets. The stock markets. The commodities markets. The money markets. They break nations.
"16/ Merit in markets is determined by a commitment of resources. The resource is money, a form of frozen and trade-able time."
15/ The 20th century created a new kind of network - market networks. Open AND meritocratic.
14/ Dictatorships are more efficient in war than democracies. The Internet and physical commons are overloaded with abuse and spam.
"13/ A few are run by the mob. Democracy. The Internet. The commons. Open, but not meritocratic. And very inefficient."
12/ Some are run by elites. The university network. The medical network. The banking network. Somewhat open and somewhat meritocratic.
11/ Many are run by corporations. The social network. The search network. The phone or cable network. Closed but initially meritocratic.
"10/ Some are run by kings and priests who choose what is money and law, sacred and profane. Rule is closed to outsiders and based on power."
9/ And the Rulers of these networks become the most powerful people in society.
8/ Network effects thus create a winner-take-all dynamic. The leading network tends towards becoming the only network.
"7/ Networks have ""network effects."" Adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants."
6/ Networks must be organized according to rules. They require Rulers to enforce these rules. Against cheaters.
5/ Money is a network. Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network. Electricity is a network...
"4/ Overlapping networks create and organize our society. Physical, digital, and mental roads connecting us all."
3/ Networks allow us to cooperate when we would otherwise go it alone. And networks allocate the fruits of our cooperation.
2/ Humans are the networked species. The first species to network across genetic boundaries and thus seize the world.
1/ Blockchains will replace networks with markets.

"Other tokens may get more usage, but they generally sacrifice some security for that usage. For a store of value, security is everything."
Blockchain development and investment aren't  concentrated in Silicon Valley - they're as decentralized as the blockchains themselves.
I don't want to publicly omit anyone. Watch the retweets üòâ.
The Internet demolished middlemen and replaced them with thin monopolies. But blockchains may liberate us from intermediaries altogether.

"Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day."
Ironic that the most monetizeable code in the world is now open source (running on blockchains). OSS has the best business model.
Nations are trying to birth the next Silicon Valley when they can simply buy the next generation of Internet protocols on open markets.
An economy run by markets / blockchains instead of middlemen / authorities would make our current society look like a communist bureaucracy.
Blockchains are a mechanism to coordinate all of society to develop and spread the next generation of Internet technology.
"At some level, all art is monkeys defacing nature."
Put your money where your mind is.
The promise of blockchains: Markets for everything. Upgrade overloaded free systems (spammed protocols) or centralized systems (banks)
The robot armies are here and they've already taken over. They're just packed into data centers to save on cooling and space.
Blockchains have high internal coordination costs for security and stability and lower external coordination costs for social scalability.
"ICOs have access to the largest investor and speculator base in the world. Freed of conflicting currencies, banks, and often...regulations."

Smart IPO investors read the prospectus. Smart ICO investors read the code.
That's all I would go to school for. The rest I would learn myself.

But believe what you will if it helps your conscience. I think fish feel pain but I'm still evolved to eat them.
"If a fish is injured, it knows not to use the affected part. Physical pain can easily exist without subjective suffering or cortex."
"Put another way, something resembling pain is adaptive and selected for. Humans who can't feel pain lose limbs (leprosy)."

Everything with a nervous system feels pain. That's what nervous systems do.
